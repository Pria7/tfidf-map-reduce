A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|the sharmancaselli tarot is one of my favorite decks  a superb creation of juliet sharmanburke and giovanni caselli it combines the best features of the popular riderwaitesmith rws tarot with elements of classic decks such as the viscontisforza tarot and marseilles tarot  however how does the mini version included in the tarot box fare  not as well as i would have wished yet if you loved the sharmancaselli tarot you may still consider to give this kit a tryas i hinted the transition of the sharmancaselli tarot to the mini format  x  inches was not the best it could have been  for example there is a very small blurring effect in the arts line work  but the most glaring mistake is on the cutting of the cards as it seems that the face and back of some are off centered in my deckif you are not familiar with the sharmancaselli tarot this deck is based on the rws tarot with inspiration from older decks such as the tarot of marseilles and the viscontisforza  like the rws tarot the imagery throughout the sharmancaselli tarot depicts the renaissance era but done with seemingly realistic art filled with soft colorsthe major arcana is mostly inspired on the rws tarot with a few exceptions  the wheel of fortune shows a wheel with four people at the top bottom and sides and a blindfolded women in its center definitely drawing inspiration from the viscontisforza tarot while the lovers shows a finely dressed man deciding between two women with cupid floating over his head an imagery more akin to the marseilles tarot  the minor arcana are fully illustrated and inspired on the rws tarotin a nod to the viscontisforza tarot the major arcana are unnumbered  if you pay attention to the order of the major arcana you will find the following  the fool the magician the empress the emperor the high priestess the hierophant the lovers the chariot justice temperance strength the hermit the wheel of fortune the hanged man death the devil the tower the star the moon the sun judgement and the world  this is the order to study the tarot recommended by sharmanburke  this was included inthe new complete book of tarot but missing from the mini tarot book included in this kitthe book in this kit is titled tarot learn how to read the cards  this is a small  x  inches pocket book but at a count of  pages i doubt anyone would carry it in hisher pocket  the book is divided as followswhat is tarotgetting to know your deckthe major arcanathe minor arcanahow to read the cardsyour first readingstaking it furtherin all this book is a larger version of a little white book  you get a brief history of tarot and then some  to my surprise there is even a description on how to play trumps with the cards  i never considered using a tarot deck for playing games before but at the smaller size the cards are very well suited for playingthree pages are spent for each card one page for the image and key issues another for symbolism and the last one for in a reading use  the final sections include layouts such as the pyramid  cards the horseshoe  cards and the celtic cross  cardsthe silliest part of this kit is the  puzzle pieces layout board  it includes the pyramid in one side and the horseshoe  honestly with a few bucks i think you could do better with a fold out plastic coated photocopy of well decorated layout of your own preferencethis is not a bad kit to start with  however if your budget is tight or you are just testing the tarot waters you may also considertarot to go  if you are a tarot collector or reader you may want to spend just a bit more and buythe sharmancaselli tarot deckinstead but beware that the card stock on this deck is of a slightly inferior quality than decks from us games inc llewellyn or even loscarabeo|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i purchased these flash cards for my first grader to add some variety in her math enrichment at home she gets tired of the same drilltype exercises found in many supplementary enrichment workbooks though i do still use them sparingly these flash cards are divided into  categories ie addition  subtraction  multiplication  division  fractions and time  moneythe answer for each question is placed on the back of the card top lefthand corner the only thing about this i did not like is that since the cards are printed on both sides with problems there are answers on both sides of the cards for each problem on the reverse this can be a tad distracting so i placed little postits which i had cut out over the answerseach stack of cards for the individual categories comes with further suggestions for learning and thinking for example the addition stack has some excellent suggestions such as an addition war highest sum wins the play at hand which sum is it lay five to ten cards give a child the answers to one of the problems then ask the child to choose the problem that matches the sum story math very creative requiring a child to choose a card and make up a story problem and quick mathif youre looking for something mathbased for young children that can be fun and educational these flash cards just might fit the bill|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my fiveyearold was learning about the butterflys life cycle at school and i thought getting this live butterfly garden would be a great idea and it was we bought one through amazon and another off a different site with the same wonderful results like many other reviewers have mentioned its preferable that one waits until spring to order this as firstly the larvae will not travel well in the cold weather and secondly releasing butterflies into the frigid cold would be a cruel thing to do also the kit does not come with the larvae  you need to mail in the voucher that comes with the kit together with a minimal processing fee of three dollars and the company will send the larvae and food we received five larvae in their own little container and food all five turned into butterflies  and watching the entire processlife cycle is a wondrous experience indeed my daughter was amazed at how the caterpillars turned into chrysalis and finally transformed into butterflies  the expression on her face alone was worth the entire experiment the butterflies are the painted lady variety and are beautiful to behold  we released them after a few days this is a wonderful learning and observational tool which will encourage childrens interest in science and to appreciate the beauty of nature highly recommended|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|i was always more of an ants in the pants fan myself but i recently played this with my young nephew and he loved it  it requires less coordination than ants in the pants so he enjoyed it more  for very young children it is a game that they need an adult for since they often dont have the patience or coordination to put the ice back in  that just means that its a good game for when playtime is also parentchild bonding time|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|like all of our other tonka trucks this thing is just virtually indestructable  ours gets almost a daily use digging in the garden and then dumping the dirt into the huge dump truck and off it goes on another adventure  my only complaint is that the digger is made of plastic and quite frustrating to a little guy who is trying to dig through some tough terrain  it can be a little trying to manipulate at times so keep this in mind when looking at the age limit  ours was bought at age  and it was still a little aggravating for him  however it has provided tons of fun both inside and out and is a very nice compliment to his other trucks  highly recommend|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|most junior versions of games are just a simplified version of the original  i love this one since its a bit different  rather than the general idea of a city with famous streets railroads and utilities play is centered around an amusement park  its much more fun for little kids and appeals to their imaginations a bit more  as an added plus it helps kids practice their math skills|spam
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my husband and i love monopoly but needed something simpler to play it with our yearold and the monopoly junior edition fits the bill perfectly the premise is simple and easy to understand making it fun for our child the game includes little ticket booths in various colors  to correspond to ones chosen token that can be purchased and put on different places on the board and which can then be used to charge rent when another players token lands on it the currency denomination comes in     and  and our yearold was able to handle giving and taking of currency quite well the only thing that we had to help her with was reading out the chance cards which require some level of reading skillother than that this is a fun game with simple rules that is not as competitive as the more grownup version of monopoly which can even test the mettle of seasoned players if your family loves monopoly and wish to include young members in the game then the junior monopoly may just fit the bill|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is great for little kids who like to mix and match things  they stick well but you have to make sure to put them back on the card properly which the directions tell you to do  we played it with the kids a couple of times and since then theyve just played by themselves  ive noticed that kids are sometimes more likely to just play with the pieces than actually play the game  its nice to have the option for them to play the game or just be creative  this is our first colorforms product and i think well be getting more|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|i got this box for my younger cousin and he loved it  it has an amazing variety of colors that just cant be beat  i couldnt believe the selection  definitely better than any of the boxes around when i was little  we had tons of fun just coloring one day  so many adults forget how relaxing coloring is  at a certain age you just stop doing it  however if youre one of the people who do back to it you can rediscover the benefits of taking the time just to sit down and color a picture|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a lovely addition to a thomas wooden set which we received after putting it on our amazon wish listwhat you should know right away the set features one  way joiner track in the front that ends in a single track  if youre like me and youre building your thomas set for your child you may not have additional switch track pieces that branch to form two tracks  this means that your childs nice circular set or figure  set as we have wont be circular any more  the tracks leading out of the back of the sheds dont have connectorsso the roundhouse is a stopping point unless you purchase or have a splitter to branch back to both ends of your circular track  so make sure you get a splitter too if you dont have onemy son absolutely loves it and i do as well  its fun to open the doors and send the engines to sleep  we also led one track around the back and hes able to complete his circular voyage by doing a little hop with the trains over the small gap where there is no connector using the roundhouse like a tunnel he doesnt have any problems opening the doors and the quality on the construction is wonderful and it is just gorgeous taking his set to a new level  i was surprised by how big it was it takes up a sizeable space on his thomas tableit is a great piece to add to your set because it offers a really different kind of interaction  most everything else is something the trains pass by or over but this one has great interactivity with the doors and pulling the engines through as well as being a stoppingstorage point for the enginesjust ignore the picture on the amazon listing that shows the turntable as that isnt a part of the set  frankly im glad he loves to make longish trains and that causes all sorts of problems when he tries to use the turntable on his take and play set|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|for anyone with a kid into building a lot with legos this is a musthave  as someone prone to stepping on anything dangerous left on the floor i can tell you that these plates are a big help  while of course kids will still leave the occasional lego lying around using the plates means it happens less frequently  it makes a great base when building and its wonderful for moving creations and displaying finished designs|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|like some other reviewers mention the ker plunk game here is an updated version of a classic game beloved by my parents and myself as children my husband and i were eager to introduce this game to our yearold and thought it would be a fun game to play with as a family we did have fun but the two adults me and hubby found the shoddy construction particularly deplorablebasically the game parts consist of two plastic tubes with a plastic connector in between these three parts are to be manually attached together and stood on the game base which is also made of plastic the plastic color sticks are then to be inserted through the little holes in the tube connector in a crisscross pattern which will serve to hold the marbles  which are provided in the boxthe problems with this game are mainly due to the cheap plastic parts  they are so insubstantial and moving the canister for each players turn is cumbersome as a result and inadvertently jolts the marbles even further luckily my yearold was patient enough with the careful manipulation during each players turn and we did have fun but we found the overall experience to be underwhelming|ham

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|trevor is a traction engine and if youre not familiar with them a traction engine doesnt run on rails and its like what it sounds  a big huge tractor really  what makes trevor really neat is although he is an engine he also has a wheel that turns on top whenever he is moved along the track  he provides tons of fun in our house and really is a unique addition to your childs train set  hes not a major player in the videos but a cute addition anyway  especially since he likes to give rides to the children  highly recommend|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we put this table and the standard table top on our amazon wish list and fortunately our sons aunt got it for him  we had just been through construction nightmares on another piece of furniture and were fearing the worst when this arrivedunlike other furniture weve purchased online just to find it arrives with damaged corners and missing parts this was extremely securely packaged with protective styrofoam each piece separated by its own molded area  dont have any shipping fears  another nice surprise  pieces are preassembled so that you only pull out five pieces the arched end pieces the side rails and the little middle rail that supports the table top  the table comes with a little box of hardware  pieces and what i must say is an adorable golden wrench  it took us  minutes to assemble and we didnt even have to look at the very easy instructions or get any other toolsthe table is gorgeous vibrantly colored and durable  my  year old son absolutely loves the little extruded train faces along the sides  its the perfect height for him and takes a lot of leaning and bashing no problem  mommy loves it too because it fits a big wooden set with plenty of parking room for all his engines which means they arent all over my housewe keep a little chair by it but he prefers to just move around and around or sit on his knees playing with it  it really completes the thomas set for usyes its pricey but keep in mind the resale value  ive never seen a thomas table below  on craigslist in our area|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|is your child getting tired of doing similar math worksheets over and over again well my first grader and i have been working on improving her math skills this summer and i realized that one surefire way to kill a childs interest in math or any other subject for that matter is the same drill type exercises found in many workbooksnow im not saying these workbooks have no place in education but i do think they should be used sparingly and there needs to be some sort of variation in instruction so that children will love learning any subjectwe tried out the money bags coin value game a skill building game and it is super fun though recommended for ages  and up i think this is an excellent game to introduce children as young as five to the concept of money and the various coin denominationsthe goal is to win the most money and the game comes with a brightly illustrated game board always great to stimulate young childrens interest a builtin spinner  plastic coins that look like real coins so that it makes teaching easier  play dollar bills  game markers and  die this is a fun and engaging math game that will have young children learning math and the value of money in no time|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i think this is a cute little game for families with younger children  my husband and i have had fun with it playing with our  year old she has actually mastered holding the fishing rod to pick up the little fish and enjoys it tremendously when played as a family we race each other to see who gets the most fish and she just giggles all the time it is also a great educational tool  as she learns to count sort the different colored fish and also improves her coordination skills on the whole this is a value for money toy  it is not exactly super durable  the fish itself are made of cheap quality plastic and the mouth easily pops off  but they are also very easy to put back together so no worries i think parents of kids below  should be careful and supervise when playing with this toy as the fish are small enough to pose a choking hazard esp if the parts pop off but otherwise this is a fun game for the family|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is a great pool for young children probably between  years old or so though it depends on their size  the sides are a little higher than some of the others marketed at this age range so water has less of a chance of sloshing out  the colors are fun and most kids seem to like them  i prefer inflatable pools as opposed to the hard sided ones  if someone accidentally falls on the side of this you dont have to worry about them getting cut|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|ive just read through some of the other reviews and i think that both amazoncom and the reviewers are both at fault for this confusion over this toy  this is not i repeat not just a stand alone toy  it is made by brio the train folks in sweden and is meant mostly to be used on the brio trainroad tracks  theyre bigger than a matchbox car and are about the same size as other wooden train pieces like thomas the train and other brio train products for train buffs theyre about the size of an ho scale train  ive also just read amazons product detail and it says nothing about the size nor the intent for which it is produced  phowever this set is wonderful and captivates my son for hours  he puts bob in scoops shovel attaches him to a batteryoperated locomotive and around the train track they go  he even takes scoop to bed with him  if you want even more fun buy the bob the builder starter set  you get muck bob and the roadway to start bobs town  its just a darling idea and a neat addition to the brio trains that you may already have  dont be afraid to buy this set  its just so very cute but also dont expect to get a very large toy  theyre expensive because theyre from brio not some piece of junk made in china  brios quality is unsurpassed and theyve earned the right in my opinion  great toy|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|ive tried a few different pool volley ball games  this one is pretty fantastic  the floating ones tend to cause issues because they dont keep the net taught and the net is too close to the pool so you hit it too often  this one has the advantage that it stays in place better and adds a little height to the net making it harder for spikes to result in someone pulling the net down|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|the age factor on this toy is very wrong  i thought it was such a great idea but as the other reviewers have said you have to push down so hard on the screen to make an impression that younger children wont be able to play with it  my little one is almost  now and has had it for  years  hes finally able to use it and actually enjoys it  its really cute when he makes an impression of his foot  that should give you some idea on how hard it is to make an impression on the screen  he stands on it  its fun for a little while but it can get boring too so allinall i would pass on this toy and look for something more user friendly for younger children|ham

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this is a great book if you have bob fans in the house  the only concern that we had with it is that it does teach insecurity through lofty saying things like im not any good for anything really doesnt do much for the self esteem in a child  as a teacher my husband was quite concerned about comments such as those stressed by lofty throughout the book  we also didnt like hearing spud saying nay nay nay nay nay not something you want to hear repeated by a threeyearold  anyway my son loves this book and plays with it throughout the day almost daily  i just wish i could edit out those things that are insecurities and it would be a great book  whenever lofty says that he cant do something my son says yes you can  so keep that in mind before buying the book  youre going to have to explain a few things as the story goes along  they really need to make more of these books with characters such as bob  theyre a bunch of fun and the musicvoices are the same as the show|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this isnt too bad of a toy overall  it teaches coordination and has the kids pick out different shapes dinosaurs etc but it really isnt all that durable  plus if you forget and leave it on and the cat walks across it in the middle of the night well its about enough to make you change your underwear  all you hear from a dead sleep is lets dance very loudly too i might add  it is a bunch of fun for little ones but our barney wont stay on nor will he stay inflated  never has  we just take him off and use it like that  it is funny though to see an animals reaction when they step on it  this thing is not quiet at all and it scares a cat half to bits  id buy another dance mat besides this one  maybe try the wiggles one  its a great idea but barney just doesnt work on this toy  it reminds me of twister but for little ones|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the design for the female tusken raider is obviously taken from the idea of a muslim burqa ive never been crazy about that as a concept because it seems a bit too close to the st century middle east rather than a galaxy far far away nonetheless this figure is pretty well done admittedly it has almost no points of articulation but i cant imagine how you would want to pose it anyway the child tusken is a nice bonus i just wish there was a way to remove the backpack from the female because without the child in it the backpack looks ridiculous|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure of course lacks almost any articulation but nonetheless still holds up even after all these years the sculpt and paint job are all of high caliber and you can pose his arms in enough ways to make him gesticulate as if giving a senate speech while id love to see some of the senate figures updated this one will probably endure well enough for several more years|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|we got this game for our daughter last year she was  and we love it based on bingo zingo basically has sturdy cardboard cards that have a  by  grid with pictures and words the cards are doublesided the green sides are for an easier play for younger children and the red sides are for more competitive play the plastic tiles are wellmade and so is the plastic dispenser for revealing the tiles younger children need not have reading skills as the pictures can help them play the game just as well  however having the words beneath the pictures reinforces learning for those who cant yet readall in all this is an immensely engaging and enjoyable game for younger children and the whole family|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|at  i still really want to play in ball pits  however they are rather hard to find for adults and places like chuckie cheese seem to frown  on adults frolicking in theirs  so until i can convince my boyfriend to let me fill the closet with these play balls and i will make it happen someday i will just have to live vicariously through my niece who has one of those little inflatable play areas made to go with these balls  i got her a bag of these balls and she loves them  theyre the somewhat soft kind so if more than one child is playing parents dont have to worry about someone throwing a ball and the play date ending in tears|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if you have boys get this train  it is so educational but durable  ours has been dropped kicked sat on you name it and it just keeps on going the only problem with this toy is that you probably need to get the rechargable batteries since it requires so many and they really dont last very long unless theyre duracells yes there really is a difference  this toy is just adorable and my other complaint is that i wish they would make more track and more blocks to put into the caboose|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|okay this set is just nothing short of wonderful  i love the train whistle especially  it has indicators engraved on it that tells you what each whistle sound means ie backing up etc  the hat is made of very strong fabric and more durable than i expected  but the train boy is it nice  the colors are bright and the train is just so well made  i particularly like the fact that you can send away and get an engraved plate for this train to commemorate a special event or just put your childs name on it  it also makes a great gift for a man to set on his desk  nice nice train and a musthave for your little boy who is into trains|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|i like intex products  ive had many over the years and they usually are good quality  theyre pretty durable and if they do get a puncture patches usually work  this sea turtle is the perfect size for kids  plus its wide enough that it tends to flip over a lot less than a lot of the other ride on toys|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|i will start off by saying that i really dont agree much with the other reviewers  as a parent you have to have a little sense in how to operate some of these toddler toys  theyre not made of steel nor are they completely idiotproof yes the trunk does not go up immediately when you turn it on thats why youre supposed to pull it up yourself according to the directions  also the butterflies have no problem coming out of ours  you can see them when theyre about to come out and if they get stuck just tap on the trunk and out they comethis is such a fun toy for a threeyearold and is marvelous in developing hand and eye coordination  plus all the giggles that it creates is just amazing and fun  i had a bunch of fun playing as did my husband too  it would be nice if there were a few more butterflies but allinall id buy this for everyone i knew  its just a great way to entertain children and teach them at the same time  it is very durable even the nets but you have to teach the children not to treat them like theyre made of flint  this toy is made to be realistic in the netting so it also is teaching children how to better care for their things  buy this game you certainly wont be disappointed|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if you have a budding baseball player in your house grab this toy  it is by far one of the best toys we have in this house  our little one just loves playing with this thing  he even changes the batting levels all on his own  it shoots those balls out pretty fast and our fouryearold can whack them almost every time  he doesnt use the tball portion very much though  but thats just him  he likes the fast balls that come out for him to hit  he can whack those balls pretty far too  across  an acre and into the street  i highly recommend this toy  it also helps train your little guy to get used to the automatic pitching machines they use in little league games now  my only complaint is that i wish we could get more balls  its tons of exercise for mom and dad to run across the yard and to put them back into the machine  the batteries last a long time too  we use duracells and havent replaced them since april four monthswait for a sale before buying this though  they usually go down about  around christmas  great toy|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|oh golly is this set cute  we just received ours and it is just amazing  the three versions of percy  coal dust percy and chocolate percy are from percys chocolate crunch and jack frost percy is from thomas snowy surprise  my little guy just carries these around all day makes believe all day with them takes them to bed you name it  its just a very cute set  if youre wondering about jack frost percy regarding the icicles they are made of a soft rubber and are quite bendable so they wont be breaking off and creating a sharp point  i would still pay attention to that age  thing though  grab these trains  you certainly wont be sorry  very highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|we got to see jack for the first time on new friends for thomas  if youre not familiar with the story jack is a front loader that was brought into the island of sodor to help with the construction of new train lines  hes very anxious to help and sometimes has to be reminded of his place but hes a very cheerful and helpful fellow  he proves himself to be a very good friend and worker and gets to stay on the islandwell we just had to get jack after seeing this video  hes been a very valuable purchase in our house  role playing abounds  its a little weird that they made his shovel solid  it should have been open so that he could scoop up things  bet this will be a redesigned piece  anyway this is a great addition to the train series and he even goes on the track highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this guy has a minor role in the thomas series but boy is he a favorite in our house  hes different  his face looks laid back and he has a smirk on his face as well  hes a bit snooty since his job is to take the duke and duchess of boxford around but since he is the fastest engine well he has a right to be snooty  hes on the video new friends for thomas and instantly became a favorite  sure am glad hes available and am wondering when max is coming out  highly recommend this one  hes really different and a great addition to our set  highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|we just had to get murdoch after viewing the video new friends for thomas he is just so very big in the video but hes about the same size as gordon here in the toy version my little one particularly appreciated the fact that hes a different color  we have a lot of blue and green trains but murdoch is sort of a dark butterscotch color hes more yellowtoned than what the above photo indicates these engines are fabulous for role playing and our murdoch even goes to bed with out little one he is two pieces like most of the other larger engines and pulls a ton of cars as well like all imginarium toys hes very durable made of wood and covered by their lifetime guarantee  murdoch hass quickly become a favorite in our house|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|boy are these toys hard to find  toysrus has them in the store too if you cant get them online  theyre a bunch of fun  the imagination factor is quite active for these toys and the stages are nice  i just wish they would fit together so that it would form a more uniform structure  however they are very nice and i highly recommend them|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this version of jabba is not half bad the skin is soft and leather giving him a realistic feel i personally love how the tongue sticks out however there is a newer versionstar wars  clone wars exclusive deluxe figure battle pack jabbas throne with oola this one has a much more realistic sculpt as well as a full dais for jabba to recline on as well as the hookah stand|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a pretty old figure but is still probably the best hoth luke we have moreover it gives you the cool ice piece that goes with the wampa figure so you can have luke hang upside down if you can find this and the wampa for a reasonable price id definitely recommend these for any hoth diorama|spam
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my two year old daughter loves playing this relaxing game right before bedtimewe will put all the little animals to sleep in their own homes before saying good night i think the animals are just the right size for little fingers though id be careful with the toddlers as the animal pieces are small enough to pose a choking hazard however with adult supervision this shouldnt be a problem my husband and i always supervise when our daughter plays with the game and put all the pieces back in the handy wooden storage box once shes done|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|jango fetts slave i is an awesome ship galoob took the original action fleet slave i and revised it to match the episode ii version but fortunately this isnt just a rehash its a new and improved version the paint on the hull is beautifully detailed the fins turn even better and lock even better than the original moreover theres no silly fuel hole on the side the only problem with the ship isnt the ship itself but the fact that it doesnt come with a figure theres no jango fett this wouldnt have been a problem with a capital cruiser but slave i is a small ship with a big cockpit and viewport and the lack of a figure means the cockpit it is just empty i cant imagine why galoob didnt include one if it did this ship would have been perfect|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this is boba fetts ship from the empire strikes backthe slave  is  long and  wide the hatch opens to fit the poseable pilot the laser rotate the wings twist and the cargo area opens to fit a han solo figure in a carbonite coffinthis is a great model for the avid collector and a great toy for the young at heart|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|rg stood out for a lot of fans because it really harkens back to the oldschool scifi vision of droids it really looks like something out of flash gordon hasbro knew how excited collectors were about rg and made this figure to high standards the paint and sculpt really give the droid a rundown feel to it it looks like he was even banged up a few times in a jawa sandcrawler there are even subtle dents and chips in the paint on purpose not due to rough handling of the figure this is definitely a musthave for any tatooine diorama i only wish lucas had included a few rs in the prequels|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|given that there were already some  other versions of the action fleet snowspeeder i wasnt even sure if this one was worth buying fortunately it is unlike the previous versions this one is a very accurate reproduction of lukes snowspeeder as it appeared in empire strikes back it has a much better paint job than the previous versions including battle damage sadly this speeder doesnt include any figures so youll need to scrounge up  rebel pilots its too bad the action fleet line was canceled  this speeder shows how good hasbro was getting at making these vehicles|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|with star wars action fleet micromachines produced one of the best line of toysmodels that i have ever seen these were made with a great balance between fidelity and durability yes these were toys but they were great models as wellthe atat is about  tall and  long the hatch and side doors open to fit a pilot and three snowtroopers respectively this one doesnt need a stand for display however the legs only swivel back and forward at the hips the knees are preposed so posability is limited yet it will pose well besides the millennium falcon slave i or imperial shuttle from the x wing miniature game just note that the at at is at bigger scale  vs over all it is an awesome model for the avid collector and a great toy for the young at heart|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this is the naboo n fighter from star wars episode the naboo n fighter is  long tail to engine and  wide engine to engine  the hatch opens to fit the poseable pilot and the landing gears deploy but rd is not removable  this toy also comes with a stand for displaythis toy is hard on the main body but the tail is made of a bendable plastic so it wont brake during play  however this is also a good model for the avid star wars collector|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|i bought this one before my baby was born and he was just enthralled with it from day one  whenever i pushed down on the star and the thing lit up he just was mesmerized by it  then he decided that being the engineer that he is hed rather play with it without the stars on it so he can see how it works  he just loves that  its just so very pretty when it lights up and it also teaches coordination  he still plays with it and hes now three  definitely a fanstastic purchase one that can withstand having food dumped on it being tossed onto the floor numerous times you name it and it is still just like new|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is a great first pool  its an excellent size  the sides are high enough to give little ones back support  perfect for hot days|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|these are great  plus if youre into scrapbooking they make neat little additions to your pages which is why i bought them in the first place  i do have to mention that although theyre great to use pay close attention to that age limit  the bottoms fall off quite readily and they really do pose a choking hazard if you have a little one who likes to put things in their mouth  plus theyre very messy if they fall into little hands unsupervised  theyre very cute and easy to use and a whole bunch of fun|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i wasnt crazy about most of the special edition additions to the max rebo band th dancing girls were tacky and the yuzzum was annoying however rappertunie always seemed pretty cool  almost like a bloated kermit the frog this figure is a good depiction of him with articulation on his thighs shoulders elbows and neck the giant harmonica fits easily into his hands and makes it look like hes really playing overall a great figure for any jabbas palace diorama|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ill be honest i was a bit worried when i saw that hasbro reused thejquillebody fortanus spijek however the body actually seems better suited to the elom than the whiphid despite the recycling this is actually a great figure the face sculpt shows a lot of detail from the scales to the teethtanus spijekalso has a long tail and a white skunk stripe neither of which are apparent in the movie while most production photos depicttanus spijekas a harmless fuzzball this figure makes him look pretty scary  almost like a muppet nosferatu overall a great addition to any jabbas palace diorama|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|of course this figure is primarily for collectors and its a good one at that it has a good paint job and likeness of general dodonna not a lot of articulation compared to todays figures but a decent amount and the arms can twist at the elbows its not the most amazing figure  nothing here is going to wow you  but certainly worth getting for fans of star wars episode iv  a new hope|spam
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i got this some months ago when my then one year old loved all things elmoshe played with it a lot and it has withstood all the cuddles handling etcbut kids do go through so many phasesso elmo is now left languishing at the bottom of the toy box as a product it is pretty good value for the money|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this toy is as basic to kids as buying diapers you need one  it really keeps our little one occupied and helps out a lot when you need some quite time and no videos etc  its very educational they can write their alphabet but also draw all kinds of shapes and objects just like an etchasketch  it reminds me of one  just with a pencil  its great for car trips and for grandmas house too  and its extremely durable  ours has been stepped on rode over you name it and its just fine  great toy|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if youre not sure if your little one will really be into these train sets this one is a great one to try out  its more fun when you get all the extra buildings but if its an iffy situation then i highly recommend this set  we bought this set for our little one because he just wasnt too sure about these trains  however after he received it he found out that he liked them and well now we have a bunch of them the  is not much to invest n a toy that theyre not going to play with either  i just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train  however you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from maxim who makes brio trains now and the train separately as well  this train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use duracell  energizer only makes it two days in this train but duracell makes it twoandahalf weeks  other than that highly recommend this toy|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if youre looking for some curves and straight track for your layout then be sure to grab this set  it has the combination of both and is a quick way to build in a hurry  and when youre  and  everything has to be fast so dont forget this|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|what a nice improvement over the first wiggles guitar  but i have to agree with the other reviewer in that this guitar doesnt really stand up too well by itself that was noted in a test run and should have been corrected however when my little one saw this in the store he wanted it desperately even though we also have the first wiggles guitar this one really is cute  it plays all the songs just by standing it up and it really does just fine when you put it up against the wall but my little one has already figured out other ways to play with it  upside down you name it its really cute watching the handle move around on this thing and its just a very cute toy a lot more realistic than the first guitar too i might add the sound chips are a little off tone wise but that doesnt detract at all from this toy and buy it here for goodness sakes walmart is  higher thats where we saw this first and my little one carried it throughout the whole store he seldom asks for a toy so when he does i know he really wants it this is a keeper no doubt there and it went to bed with him tonight theres a true test for any toy turn on the wiggles live cd with this in the house and it really makes for a very fun time for the whole family highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|im not too sure why amazon categorizes these corgi cars as toys theyre really just collector cars  this one is very detailed and quite funny looking  it has provided quite a lot of laughs for all the little boys that run through this house  this is definitely more for a collector both older boys and men will enjoy  the s version of this car is just outstanding  highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|boy what a great investment this was  we bought this along with the front loader and wow does it get used a lot  my little one just loves filling up that front loader and dumping stuff into the back of this dump truck  the dump truck then goes all over the place delivering whatever is in the back and comes back for more  he goes through sand mud you name it and looks great  these trucks clean up very easily and dont marr hardwood floors  its pretty cute seeing how many things he can do with this truck  it just provides hours of fun for him|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|we bought this for my threeyearold and he absolutely loves it  being the little engineer that he is he just sat there for hours watching that ferris wheel go around trying to figure out how it worked  he plays with this thing all the time at least  hours on a daily basis  its so easy to assemble and tons of fun  he particularly loves whacking the cars up the channel to swirl down to the ferris wheel  that ferris wheel is just very neat  what a cool idea  plus its made well so theres nothing bad to say about it  great toy|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|i was a little surprised upon receiving this that only thomas james and percy were on both the fork and spoon our grandson would have liked it better if the whole steam team had been included those mentioned along with edward henry gordon toby and emily instead of the odd items that separate them  the handles of both fork and spoon are identical with a light blue railroad track running the length of the handle against a darker blue background the top has a yellow circle with a blue t in the center then comes thomas then a clock showing  why then james then a yellow circle with a blue bus in the center why then percy then a red circle with a blue  in the center  if they hadnt included the circles there wouldve been room for the whole steam team on each handle or else  members on the fork and  on the spoon  regardless our older grandson did look forward to using these at lunchtime when i babysat for him and our younger one is just starting to use them so theyre sturdy enough to have held up well for close to  years  the fork is   long and the spoon is just a hair shorter  the only other thing id point out is that the slope of the spoon is minimal so for a little one just beginning to use utensils instead of fingers its a little difficult to keep those peas on the spoon long enough to reach the mouth  overall for  this was an okay purchase|ham
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|i gave this to a  year old for her birthday and she loves it  the working locks and brass keys are great  she really enjoys the little dolls that came with the house too  her parents say its worked out great for car trips or play dates since its easy to carry|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|i think this wiggles toy is their first big stinkaroo  the age limit here is just way off  theres no way a fiveyearold would want to play with this toy  it cannot keep the attention of a threeyear old  its really a baby toy  the keyboard is very small about  inches  inches smaller than a barbie doll if that gives you a better idea and it only plays just a few songs  they could  have done a lot better on this one especially since jeff plays the keyboard  how about one that stands up instead  that would have been much much better than this one  i hoenstly think theyre in such a hurry to put anything out with the wiggles on it so they do not worry so much about the quality  this one just isnt really worth the money unless youre buying it for a oneyearold  i guess i was just so shocked when i saw it that i was really questioning how much fun it would be  of all the wiggles toys we have this one has the least interest  i hear mommy this is boring because theres nothing much to do with it  this is a great idea but they really needed to expound it further before producing this toy|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|first of all this is a huge improvement over the monkey face leia from the potf figure in from the mids its an appropriate feminine version of leia the face looks a bit too dolllike but the body and sculpt are good and shes got decent articulation i havent seen any better versions of the hairbun leia since so get this one if you want to recreate the death star rescue scene|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i got this darth vader as part ofstar wars episode  collectible tinthe sculpt of this figure is really good  it holds up well to the test of time when compared against better versions found in the vintage collection  this figure includes a light saber and an unlit light saberit has ballhinged shoulders and knees swivel head elbows forearms waist and hips but no ankles articulationthe swivel elbows are not as bad for posing as first expectedthis figure has great likeness and good articulation|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its unfortunate that there hasnt been a better release of bespin lando since this  figure fortunately this guy has aged pretty well except for the swivel elbows hes got a good range of articulation the likeness does look a bit more tough or carl weatherslike than billy dee williams friendly lando that we all remember from the movie but its still a pretty close match while i hope theres a vintage version on its way soon if youre looking for a lando for your cloud city diorama this is your best bet|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|overall this is a beautiful figure i agree with the other reviewer that parts of the figure can be a pain but when you get it to pose the way you want to its simply beautiful i love the paint and sculpt job the cloth the wookie braids  easily the best of all the boba fetts and there are a lot of them here are a few other things id notefirst the jetpack sometimes is a bit loose but it is possible to push it in tight i actually found that pushing it in over a bit of the cloth helps secure it after doing that ive had no problemssecond the head is a bit of a pain to move but not too bad just remove the helmet before moving the head that way you dont bend the helmetthird he doesnt hold his rifle well with just one hand it looks like its pointing too high it is possible to pose him holding the rifle trigger with his right hand and the barrel with the left not only does this fit the figure but it looks pretty awesomethat said because of these issues id really only recommend this figure for collectors not kids hes great to pose but probably wouldnt last long in a year olds bedroom|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|i looked all over the place for something like this and finally found it in the jcp catalogue  its a little stiff going presumably because its for the little guys but it is definitely a great toy  ours gets tons of use even by a threeyearold  i love the convertible seat so that it grows with the child  ours has been marked on drooled on eaten on spilled on and it still looks new  this thing just wears and wears and is just a great toy  however if you have a rather rambunctious little one dont be too far away  it can tip since theres not as much weight in the bottom of it  great toy otherwise though  especially if you have a jumperlover in your house like we do|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a great representation of admiral ozzel the imperial officer who learnt that coming out of hyperspace too early isnt a good career move moreover in my opinion its also perhaps the best representation of any imperial officer ever put out by hasbro rather than simply a smooth olivegreen uniform ozzels uniform actually has a texture that feels like cloth he has a decent amount of articulation for a  figure my only complaint is that he cant ever fully straighten his arm especially his left arm which is positioned at an acute angle its not a significant problem but would have been nice to have gotten a greater range of motion|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a decent bossk and much better than the earlier one however the newer one is a lot better with many points of articulation this guys stance is a bit awkward id really only recommend this one if you strongly dont like articulated figures or the inevitable seams that show up|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i purchased the fleur de lis knight by schleich as part of a few accessories i bought to go with my daughters new castle the melissa and doug deluxe wooden foldout princess castle the attention to detail is surprising given the reasonable price and its a nice size too not so tiny that it makes it hard to manouver and play with but great if one has a play castle and wants to indulge in some imaginative play the knight comes on a horse and with a lance the knight can be detached from the horse and the lance is standalone too i also purchased a fairy the green dragon and a catapult from the line by schleich i plan to add to the collection as this is something i can enjoy playing with my yearold daughter and the figures are all sturdy and durable as for educational value id say its quite high  it encourages young children to make up stories think in creative ways and stirs their imagination highly recommended|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|what a neat toy  this has been the best addition to our train set for quite awhile  my only complaint is that the coal car should be a little larger but other than that this thing is nothing short of awesome  my little one plays and plays with this thing and weve had it for over a year now  it is clearly the favorite and ive now been told that i can get rid of all the other trains but we have to keep the polar express  this is made by brio so it doesnt really have all the details the thomas trains have but its no less entertaining  it doesnt use batteries that much  ours last at least a couple of months before wearing out  its just a very neat way to bring the movie to life in your own home and quite the treasure  if you can find one try ebay grab it  it certainly is worth every penny  great toy highly recommend|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is quite a fun game  its great for either family game night or as a party game with friends  the only problem i have encountered is if you play with friends who tend to connect too well  there are some people out there that seem to just know what the other is thinking  a couple of my friends are like that and for some games one has to cover their ears when the other goes otherwise no one has a shot  linq is good since you never know who the connected people are so it adds another element|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|you have to buy this car  hands down one of the coolest batmobiles ever  honestly is there really anything cooler for a boy than batman and his car  anyway the darts in this car require manipulation for them to snap in just right to refire which is great to teach young hands dexterity and just basically how to figure out things and solve problems  other than that our batman fits in and off he goes zooming after the joker after bouncing off the cats tail  great great toy one that goes to bed with my youngster at night and incredibly cool  we also have the remotecontrolled one which is a blast as well highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|first of all cool idea  but dont buy this for a fouryearold  this one definitely pay attention to the age detail  although it just looks like you shoot the guy and batman slides down a cord it isnt quite that simple  the string on which he slides down gets tangled quite easily but it is easily untangled as well  if nothing else it teaches dexterity and patience but its well worth the wait  its very cool seeing batman slide down the string and then pretend to have him zip over a building etc after a bad guy  my little one loves to play with this thing and doesnt mind a bit if mom has to help batman get out of a jam  makes for some very creative fun  highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this guy is a lot of fun in this house  his cape actually comes off so if youre worried about that thing never fear  its pretty cool watching the thing pop in and out but that only lasts for a few minutes then they want him to just be able to go to bed with them carry them easier etc without worrying about that cape  it has a wirelike apparatus attached so it would be uncomfortable for the child to roll over on it in the middle of the night  other than that its incredibly realistic is a ton of fun and a great compliment to all the other batman figures out there  highly highly recommend|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ok the idea of a cyclops in the mos eisley cantina is a bit odd but this figure does a good job of making myo seem like an alien that could really fit into the world of star wars the face has a lot of detail which is nice because in the movie myos face is covered by shadow i like the fact that his cup is half blue half white making it look like its actually filled with a drink another great alien for those cantina dioramas|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a pretty good rendition of the gotal from the cantina scene hes got a surprisingly bright color scheme but hes otherwise pretty one ugly goat since there were multiple gotals in the movie this guy is a musthave i absolutely love how he holds his glass of red juice so well  he looks like a classic bar patron my only criticism is the blaster  its very rubbery and looks a bit bent but then again the character in the movie didnt even have a blaster so it doesnt really bother meunfortunately he seems pretty expensive  i found mine for double the store price and the prices listed here are even higher hopefully you can find a few cheap ones and have a few milling around the bar|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure has a great amount of detail and the little nose tubes are a nice touch unfortunately there are a few problems with the construction and paint job at least with the one i got the left arm is a bit loose at the elbow theres a slight bit of hair that isnt painted right where it touches the forehead the biggest problem is the neck  it just doesnt match dannik jerrikos darker face making the neck stick out like a pink thumb its too bad because with a bit more care this could have been a great figure|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this is our second remotecontrolled car and it is really quite fun when you figure out how to use it  its hard to master and i suppose if i was buying it for a young child i wouldnt give it to him right away maybe wait a couple of years  it is difficult getting that battery in and out and it does stick out the back but this car goes super fast zips over a cats tail with ease and it does jump  it is quite cool but you really have to figure the thing out  its not a plug it in and go type of toy but something probably more suited for an adult  i do recommend this toy but with the above suggestions|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|these are great  i would highly recommend these for young children  theyre sure to provide hours of entertainment  the colorful eggs are fun for kids to find the first time they open them and the peep it a cute sound  i like them because they help with matching  kids can match the face on the shell with the face on the egg plus match the shapes up  good learning tool|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these are just repackaged versions of the  jawa figures theyre not bad but there are much better ones out there now hasbro basically put a joint right at their waistlines so they could sit however this makes the figures look pretty silly plus since when do jawas need to sit|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure is rather old and doesnt have the detail or articulation modern collectors demand still it really does capture the evil essence of emperor palpatine he doesnt have any feet the base is solid so its pretty easy to stand him up the cane is a nice accessory overall there are better versions of palpatine out there i likeemperor palpatine star wars legacy collection action figure accessories  build a droid piece but this one is great for dioramas|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|considering that this is still the most recent lobot figure were fortunate that this  version of everyones favorite cloud city cyborg was done well it doesnt have the type of modern articulation of more recent figures but the swivel arms provide a surprisingly good range of motion more importantly the face is very realistic lobots outfit looks a bit too blue in my opinion really a shade of egg blue but i guess even he has to change his clothes sometime i hope hasbro releases a vintage series version of this figure but if not this one can stand proudly in your collection|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is a great versatile game  the other versions are fun but because of the letters this one is great for young children just learning their alphabet  they never know what order the letters will be in so its great for helping them learn to identify letters independent of alphabetical order  ive found that you can play it in a group by setting a timer and each person has a certain amount of time to find as many things as possible  kids love the competition and you can always go around a few times without players getting too bored  its more challenging than find it pictures or some other games since every time you move the tube items shift slightly|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is a great family or classroom game  really young kids can play with just a basic understanding of green  go red  stop while older kids can practice their basic math skills  ive heard of numerous variations to make the game more challenging such as switching the meaning of colors adding point values to colors etc  i love the simplicity of this game  its so easy to learn and play that it makes a great game for wide age groups  the components are so simple just dice that fit in a plastic bag that comes with the game that it can be taken anywhere  id highly recommend this to parents or teachers|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|after having all the justice league guys all over the house i decided to hunt up a place for them all to live and finally found this case its really nice too  nothing at all like my old barbie doll cases  this case has places to actually slide the figures into the slots and they actually stay in place without flopping around whenever carried  its really nice how they stay so very neat and dont get scratched up at all  if you can find one i bought mine on an online auction site be sure to grab it  its well worth the money highly recommend|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|as an educator and tutor i find many children struggle with their multiplication facts and this leads to frustration in learning when they advance through the grades especially when they are tackling complex multiplication problems and also long division when i recall my elementary school days i remember my teacher requiring all of us to memorize the multiplication tables from  through  and after doing so over and over through the course of several weeks i found i could recall the multiplication tables quickly through memory work and didnt have to add the numbers as many kids do these days it is rote memory work but it works and i can still remember the facts till todayi wanted to start my second grade daughter on her multiplication facts and have been using these cards over the last couple of weeks i have been encouraging her to say them out loud in full eg  times    and so on working through all the way to  times   because i find that if one just calls the answer out it doesnt quite stick in the mind now i do think it is important to explain the basics of multiplication before starting this rote exercise because a child needs to understand how multiplication works connections can also be made for example any number multiplied by zero  zero and so on so that a child understands how numbers work when multiplied once the foundations are laid rote work can begin and it is quite effective over the course of almost a month my child has memorized most of the multiplication table and at this point she is trying to master the more difficult numbers such as the  times table and  times tablethese cards are wellmade of quality stock cards and of course one can laminate them if you wish them to hold up for a longer period and if you have other children youd like to use them with also for classroom or homeschooling use i sorted them out into several piles beginning from the zero times table till the twelve times table and sometimes i mix them up to ensure she has got the facts down another plus point in these cards is that each card has only one fact  the question is on one side and the answer is on the other which makes it less confusing paying a little extra for this convenience is well worth itthese cards work well with other strategies such as a multiplication matrix which helps a child see the connections and short cuts in multiplication facts i also try to play some games to mix it up a little to make learning fun the sense of accomplishment a child feels after successfully mastering multiplication facts is truly a joy to behold|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|at  i still really want to play in ball pits however they are rather hard to find for adults and places like chuckie cheese seem to frown on adults frolicking in theirs so until i can convince my boyfriend to let me fill the closet with these play balls and i will make it happen someday i will just have to live vicariously through my niece who has one of those little inflatable play areas made to go with these balls i got her a bag of these balls and she loves them theyre the somewhat soft kind so if more than one child is playing parents dont have to worry about someone throwing a ball and the play date ending in tears the bag is great too  keep it around and it makes great storage for when you arent using the balls|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|one thing you have to know about this toy is that the darts do not glow in the dark by themselves  i really couldnt believe it when we had to actually put paper on the darts to make them glow  thought that was exceptionally cheesy for nerf  not used to that from them  anyway the gun just fires in constant repetition soars as high as the foot ceiling and beyond and those darts really stick once theyve been dispelled by the gun  its a ton of fun no doubt there but if youre playing in the dark the light inside gives away your position  other than that highly recommend|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|what a neat book this one is  its a little more difficult for a kindergartener but definitely get them started on this book it teaches such a myriad of things  particularly hand and eye coordination  one of the games has them driving the batmobile through the streets of gotham city to trap the bad guys joker etc but if you slip up at all and accidentally get off the road the game is over and the bad guy gets away  it definitely takes some skill and attention so if youre needing that be sure to grab this book  this is one of those books that gets a ton of play in our house and im growing concerned that ill have to buy a second one soon after this one wears out  highly recommend|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|sora bulq is one of the critical characters in the clone wars comics so its great to finally get a figure of him dont worry even though this figure is over  years old he still holds up well hasbro did a great job with the articulation and paint what really impresses me is the hair its a soft plastic and flexible simulating realistic hair the only major problem is that he lacks knee articulation but hes preposed in a dramatic pose that looks great as if hes got forward momentum definitely recommended|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i used to love the original momaw nadon figure however this one is a lot better the paint job and sculpting are very realistic he comes with a glass and a staff which are more realistic items than the doublebarreled gun from the original figure i highly recommend this figure if youre a fan of the ithorians|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is probably one of the freakier cantina aliens and definitely a musthave for any cantina diorama hem dazons legs are cool looking with an added joint just above the ankles his eyes have an almost iridescent glow the triangular head is also a distinct departure from the humanoid heads of most aliens the only problem i had is that his feet dont seem to stand perfectly flat against the ground alas even he cant be perfect|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|garindan is one of the most beloved figures in the star wars universe fortunately this update makes him proud the imperial jump suit is much more realistic his snout is a bit longer than the original figure most important of all his cape looks fabulous im usually not a big fan of using cloth on star wars figures but it was done very well for garindan the cape wraps around him just as in the movie of course the originals a classic but this one is even better|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i like that this sandtrooper has sand weathering it looks good it would have been nice if this one had a rifle instead of the small blaster but its still a good one to get to create an army of sandtroopers|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|compared to the most recent ewok figures in the vintage line chirpa doesnt have quite as much articulation particularly around the angles and wrists also the left side of his hood blocks his arm from rotating too far forward that said its more than compensated by the fact that hes got some awesome accessories not only does he have a detailed cane but his belt also has a knife sheath with a removable knife this guy is definitely a worthwhile edition to your ewok village|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|im collecting return of the jedi figure because im trying to complete my kenner collection from  years ago with better sculpted and articulated figures  this one was not in my list as i excluded many from the power of the force but it looked too cool to passthis death star gunner is from the saga collection as seen in the return of the jedi moviethis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders and knees swivel elbows gloves waist and hips but no articulated anklesthis figure include a flexibleplastic chest armor and removable helmet  it also includes a blaster that fir well in the hand but doesnt work as well in the holsteroverall this figure offers great likeness and good posability|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this luke along with han solo and leia from their adventure in endor are the first figures i buy since  however i couldnt wait for the package to arrive and using early christmas shopping as an excuse i bought a few from the vintage collection on the stores how things have changed in  yearsthis figure is from the saga collection luke as seen in the film return of the jedi  the face has an incredible resemblance to mark hamill and the body is very detailed as well it wears a fabric poncho a plastic helmet and a belt with a holster out of the box  the holster can actually hold the blaster  all of these can be removed leaving luke in his black jedi tunic  of course this figure also includes a green lightsaberthis figure has a swivel neck shoulders elbows wrist and torso and ballhinged kneesthis was a bit of a surprise since han solo and leia have better articulation than this one  still this figure offers a lot of options for posing yet the swivel neck and elbows is a good trade off for a more seamless look  unfortunately the portion of the tunic below the belt is plastic which hinders the swivel of the legs a lot  however this figure has a great grip with both hands and can hold the lightsaber single handed or dual handedoverall this figure offers great likeness but average posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this boba fett is more for kids its still pretty well sculpted and painted but the jetpack moves the arms and its obviously more for playing than posing|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|one thing i appreciated about the tartakovsky clone wars was its bold visual images one of the coolest images was that of the talz jedi whod have thought wed ever see one of those much less get a figure of him one of the most exotic looking jedi everhasbro made the character in realistic style so he looks fine next to the regular star wars figures yes its a retool of muftak the talz from the cantina yes it would have been great if hasbro had added more articulation particularly at the elbows but you know what it works this figure looks awesome the clothes and boots are fully removable which both makes them look more realistic and allows you to use this figure as a generic talzone problem some might find is that the lightsaber handle is too small for foul modama to hold onto tightly he simply wont hold it i found that switching it with his best friendroron corobbslightsaber which has a thicker handle works well and moudamas lightsaber looks great in corobbs hands this is something hasbro should have fixed but certainly doesnt doom the figure if youre willing to pull a switch besides moudama and corobb are buddies and need to be togetheroverall a nice tribute to tartakovskys series|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|we actually won this figure from the quaker oats company in their online search for superman  that said im not sure i would have purchased this one in particular  the thing that superman is tossing contains a piece of kryptonite and hes supposed to smash it down to the ground  his arms work great but when the little gray box thing is put together it comes apart way too easily making it quite difficult to actually get it into supermans hands  but his arm action is quite fun even without the box thing so weve gotten a ton of play from this one  great stuff but i think id recommend getting one of the others  particularly the one that makes the flying sounds when he whizzes through the air  we love that one|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|these little action figures are just great if you want to get your little superhero something by which to remember the movie but you dont want to spend a bunch  my little guy just loves these things  he can smash the kryptonite all he wants plus superman flies through the air saves the day goes to bed at night all tuckered out like the rest of us  cant really say enough good about them  just that theyre getting worn out at our house  highly recommend|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its sad that after all these years this figure is one of the better darth mauls around its an oldie from around  but stands well and has a fair number of dramatic poses while the cape and hood are plastic theyre quite detailed and look like flowing robes not a bad figure if you want a hooded maul the minisith infiltrator is a great bonus|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember when i was younger the original greedo the jacket was stuck to the figure and greedo had bulging muscles and a huge chest  exactly the opposite of his lowlife character in the movies this version is a vast improvement greedo is tall and lanky just like hes supposed to be im not sure im crazy about the felt jack  id have preferred plastic because the original jacket looks more like a synthetic material rather than fur nonetheless a great figure|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|while id liked most of the hasbro star wars figures i had always been disappointed with the various versions of the tusken raider no longer this star wars  vintage sand people figure is the definitive version of the tusken raider the basic design of the figure looks like the original s version more than the s one which i thought was disappointing but with much better materials sculpting and paint the cloth looks extremely realistic and has a rough gritty texture appropriate for desert nomads the robes flow around the figure and can be positioned for dramatic effect the figure stands decently so id recommend a stand for more dramatic or exotic poses then again i positioned mine charging forward without a stand and hes standing up fine so far despite what the other reviewer said i thought that it has more than enough articulation with the arms legs and head  i cant think of any other points of articulation missing the gaffi stick and rifle are also well done|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this is such a great batman set  killer crocs boat is so neat  it even attaches to the batboat to be towed in to commissioner gordon  i particularly liked the attention that was paid to the design of this set even batmans cape was packaged by itself in a cardboard box to keep it neat  great great attention to detail the boat motors mimic those of the batmobile complete with the fins  we had a blast putting this together however it does come apart rather easily with play so pay attention to the age on this one  other than that it is very highly recommended in this house|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|grab this guy if you can find him  if you cant try your local krogers store believe it or not  you just cant believe the stuff you find in there these days  this doll is just wonderful  its as realistic as a doll can be and even more so since its made more like a doll than an action figure  you can still see the facial features of ken there so dont think its an exact replica of brandon routh although that would be nice  it is missing the clark kent costume which was a little surprising to me but other than that its a wonderful thing highly recommend|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this gun is really a bunch of fun in this house  the laser can be used to pinpoint exactly what your aims desire may be and since it comes apart that is done quite easily  the worst part of the gun is the fact that it is so big its quite cumbersome  especially so for the little guys about  and under  this gun is used mostly separately in our house or its set up on the kitchen table and fired into the drapes into the family room  to actually carry the thing its quite difficult for even a sevenyearold  other than that its been a load of fun but be sure to get replacement darts at target  theyve been the cheapest ive found  highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|we received this guy as a birthday present after much waiting and determination  but i have to say that for a nineyearold this guy is quite the tedious task  the wings move in such a way that if you misassemble the included rubber bands the thing just wont work at all and the wings fall off quite readily  sure is cool when its done though  it is designed beautifully and contains the most popular minifigures as well  it can withstand some play but then again after you get the thing together youre too afraid to touch it ever againgreat set overall but again if youre giving it to a younger boy be prepared to help with the assembly  its definitely worth it because its definitely one of the nicest sets weve purchased  nice colors too highly recommend|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|this oven is very cute but not very durable  the onoff switch jammed and broke within a year of use so it had to be tossed  plus it uses something as weird as a  watt candelabra bulb to bake the bugs  wow  it does work well though when the switch is working and bakes really cute bugs  the only downside i can say from it is that its hard to really tell when theyre done since the bugs are completely enclosed within the machine the entire time theyre baking  this is not at all like the open version we had in the s  if you can honestly get on an online auction site and try to get a s thingmaker machine and the molds  youll be happier with the results  if you cannot this works fine but just remember to buy a bunch of bulbs because they do burn out quickly since they kids will use this thing nonstop once they get one  this is greatly grealy loved in our house and i do recommend it with the above limitations  in addition if youre looking for more goop and cant find it try the online auction site with an e  weve used their goop and have had very nice results with it  the goop is hard to find even amazon didnt have it at christmas this year  dont know why either|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily one of the best star wars vehicles hasbro has made yet of course its awesome as the only example of a true sith ship we ever see in the films however hasbro did a particularly good job i really appreciate the fact that hasbro did not sacrifice the design or dimensions of the ship just so it could fit a figure i hated how the old millennium falcon had a huge cockpit and relatively tiny hull by contrast this ship almost looks like a model and is a nearly perfect replica of the one from the moviehaving said that there is a hidden missile launcher when you pull open the hull i guess this is for kids but even when i was a kid i hated when hasbro added these types of features on vehicles fortunately if you keep the hull closed its fairly inconspicuous i just pretend it doesnt existi did see that other reviewers complained about the size of the ship all i have to say is get real hasbro is not going to make a huge version of this ship  the company knows not enough people would pay for it this ship is rare enough to find and costs a good deal secondhand i got mine off ebay for a reasonable price but many are sold for double what i paid so no the ship is not scale to the darth maul figure however as a fan of the old action fleet line it is scale to the action fleet figures thus you could just use it as a ship versus say the naboo starfighter or the droid fighters i dont even bother to put my darth maul figure in the cockpit which is basically just greyoverall definitely get this ship if you are a fan of star wars vehicles  or if you have fond memories of the action fleet line|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the basic choice with this figure is this do you prefer plastic or fabric clothes if the latter then the new star wars  vintagestyle carded darth sidious  foil carded variant is a much better option it has flowing cloth robes and an extremely detailed face this version is probably better if you prefer the plastic robes|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i know darth malak isnt the coolest looking sith lord but this figure is still a pretty decent replica of him i particularly like the face i looks pained and injured you can take the mouthguard off and see his injuries hes missing half a jaw unfortunately the elbow joints  or lack thereof  take this figure down a notch for me malak has swivel elbow joints not the more advanced ball joints this limits how you can pose him and also is a bit more conspicuous on the figure itself not too bad but i just dont understand why hasbro took this approach for malak but notably gave revan fully articulated arms still a great figure for kotor fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its nice to see lando in a different outfit this isnt the best paint job and the swivel elbows limit articulation but given that lando only wore this outfit for a few seconds on film its a miracle theres even a figure off it my biggest complaint is the legs they seem a bit too close together and the knee joints extend past  degrees so he can bend his leg forward at unnatural angles despite that he looks really good in the bmf millennium falcon|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its always nice to get expanded universe characters in hasbros figure line its even better when those characters are memorable individuals who play an important part in the stories rather than the random assortment of goons who populated the comic packs sublime tycho celchu comes with two helmets which is a nice touch his hair is probably a bit too blond for the character most sources depict him as dark blondlight brown but his face definitely captures the youthful arrogance of a young rogue squadron pilot definitely nice to have in the collection|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|what can i say hasbro knew fans wanted a nice version of darth revan and they got it this is a beautiful figure the arms have all the points of articulation modern fans demand the cloak is plastic but is painted in dull colors so it almost looks like cloth its a neat effect you can also take the cloak off to reveal revans head which looks like its wrapped in bandages but not his facethe only thing lacking is articulation for the legs basically the legs have no articulation this works fine in most cases because revans legs are under his cloak but it would have been nice to have the option for additional poses also an additional lit blue lightsaber would have nice so we could switch i took one from a jedi knightbe warned though this figure is rare and expensive you might be able to find one cheaper on ebay but star wars fans love revan and hasbro unfortunately didnt produce enough of them as happens so often so be prepared to spend at least  times the normal price for a figure if you want to add revan to your collection|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|in an interview about the cantina scene mark hamil famously described kitik keedkak as a giant cricket unfortunately the tech crew never really got this alien down well enough for a closeup in the movie but you can see him in the background i was excited to finally see a figure of this guy to add to my cantina scene when kitik keedkak get his own figure you know that hasbro has made figures just about every other alien as such this guy is great for collectorsthe figure itself is somewhat stiff like the prop used in the movie she cant bend his arms much or turn her head also the stand says attack of the clones even though kitik keedkak only appears in a new hope however the detail and painting are great for collectors she stands well enough to ask wuher for a glass of cricket juice or whatever she drinksmy recommendation would be to buy the threeset with wuher dr evazen and kitik keedkak star wars original trilogy collection  mos eisley cantina w dr evazen wuher and kitik keedkak action figure multipack if you dont already have the other two figures if you do have them id recommend getting kitik keedkak to fill out the cantina|spam
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i got this for my daughter when she was  and she enjoys it till today almost  the rules are simple and easy to follow and for a preschooler doesnt require any reading skills or long attention span the cherries are small so there is a choking hazard for those under  but this game has educational value too  placing the cherries on the trees refines motor skills and there is counting involved  and parents can also teach mathematical concepts such as addition and subtraction to those children who are eagerwilling to learnthe games premise is simple  the first player to fill hisher bucket with  cherries wins the game but there are setbacks making it more fun  if the arrow lands on a dogbird two cherries need to put back on the tree and if the arrow lands on a picture of a spilled basket then all the cherries need to be returned from the bucket to the tree this helps teach patience to young children and also taking turnsall in all an excellent educational and fun board game for preschoolers|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|santa brought this blaster this year and well after long arduous pleas for it it is sitting in the toybox  was even told i wish i hadnt asked for it  i suppose if the child is at least  more like  it would be better but since it is so heavy and cumbersome its quite difficult for the boys to work it and use it for any length of time the silly string it comes with as webs is gone in about  minutes and is incredibly over priced the different web tubes are quite difficult to manuever and the boys had to be helped with changing the type of ammo they wanted to use  for as pricey as this guy is there are other web blasters out there sold separately that contain each one of these shooters individually and in twos  to be honest theyd add up to more than this one bought separately but it is worth it in my book  we have  of the other ones and the boys have much more fun using them because theyre lighter and easier to manuever  this was used by  and yearolds and they much much preferred the single web blasters over this one  again if theyre older this would probably be more fun  but for little fingers and arms you might want to consider the smaller blasters  sorta recommend with caution to the age factor|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|first of all dont be confused by amazons listing this isnt a toy its a work of art neca has really outdone itself this time with this gollum figure this figure is perhaps a perfect blend of articulation and aesthetics you can pose him in almost any way you want and he looks amazing in those poses neca spared no expense with the paint applications gollum looks incredibly realistic you can even see the faint blue veins running along his foreheadone thing thats worth mentioning is that in hand gollum actually looks better than the prototype photos amazon has posted here in those pictures it looks like the joints really stick out almost like an old wooden puppet im glad to say that in hand the joints blend much better into the rest of the figure so dont be put off by the photos herethe only problem with this figure is that gollum doesnt include the ring it would have been nice for neca to have at least given us a small ring to go with him fortunately it turns out that the lego gold ring from the lego hobbit playsets fits the  scale gollum perfectly and you can buy them on ebay for about a dollar so id definitely recommend getting one to make gollum completein short this would have been my favorite adultcollector toy from  but its such fine craftsmanship that calling it a toy seems like a disservice if youre a fan of peter jacksons take on gollum just get this|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this doll has the best song out of all the dolls with the singing microphones  as with the others my  year old constantly misplaces microphones and then has a doll that doesnt work  i would have liked this better if you could press a button on the doll and it would also sing without the microphone being needed  that said if you get the set you can use any microphone with any doll to make a microphone work|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i do get the concept of the doll  that it gives girls a chance to sing to the music or allow the doll to sing if they want to hear the lyrics  but anytime you have two pieces one is going to end up getting lost  the microphone never seems to end up in the same place as the doll so the doll doesnt see as much use as the dolls that sing without needing an accessorymy  year old has this and the other singing microphone dolls  the microphones are interchangeable and you dont have to match them up  i wish more of the song was sung and that the dolls were more interesting looking|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|along with the tie defender and ewing jabbas sail barge was one of the rarest and most sought after action fleet items in the late s while the sail barge might not seem like the makings of a great action fleet ship this one is pretty good on its own its pretty realistic looking and probably still one of the best toys of the sail barge weve yet seen the hidden compartment with jabba doesnt do much for me but its not bad to have and is pretty inconspicuous also the figures are way too large for the ship but again under the sails are pretty inconspicuous the sails do twist and can come off a nice feature if you want to add more figures underneath the sails overall this is a nice ship but isnt big enough to be proportional to the figures fortunately this ship isnt nearly as tough to find as the tie defender and ewing and you can probably find one for a decent price|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its too bad this set is so hard to find the figures are all great depictions of force unleashed star galen marek theyre all well sculpted and painted the sith stalker is the most visually interesting a cruel mix between darth vader and starkiller the light side galens brown and white robes are a nice twist on the traditional brown jedi robes the plastic good and cloth sleeves work well the key figure is the galen in battle suit overall its a great figure but the ankle articulation is a bit limited preventing you from putting him into a runningaction pose if you can find this set for a decent price definitely get it|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its great to finally have some of the sith lords from the expanded universe i got this set particularly for darth bane who has become one of my favorite star wars characters ever after reading drew karpyshynspath of destruction kotor ii fans will also want to get darth nihilusthe darth bane accessories are probably not technically accurate according topath of destruction which describes banes robes as black also banes lightsaber is clearly red and is frequently described as having a hook like dookus but i like them anyway hasbro did a nice job of giving bane a purple color scheme with subtle purple highlights on the cape also his lightsaber is amethyst like mace windus the overall effect is to give bane a somewhat more exotic yet royal look which complements the otherwise ridiculouslooking orbalisks i have seen some fans repaint this figure black and give him a red lightsaber but then bane looks like just another dark jedi this is one case where hasbros mistake made for a visually more interesting figure i only wish they had taken more care with the orbalisks they are a seethrough yellowish plastic which isnt horrible but almost look a bit too bright also when you take the orbalisks off banes chest theres not much underneath  indeed he looks like he shed  poundsi havent played kotor ii so i cant comment too much on darth nihilus he looks like a sith with the creepy skull helmet the tattered cloth cape has a great effect flowing behind him in fact this is one of the few figures i wish had entirely cape clothing because i think it would have given the figure a real sense of formlessness as it stands this figure is great however my understanding was that nihilus was like a vacuum of dark energy this figure has dreadlocks under the hood which seems to imply that there was a man behind the mask i didnt like that touchand the darth maul figure do we really need another one this ones pretty good but with so many other great sith lords out there its a shame the third figure in the set is maul oh well|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a nice set if you want to build up fighter squadrons and need more imperial pilots they all have removable helmets  with jango fetts face  and full articulation however be careful of overpaying for this set online especially if youre only looking for one of the figures also hasbro is releasing the tie fighter pilot separately later this summer so if you just want that one it probably better to wait for that one|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|given that there is already a vintage boba fett and a vintage jango fett on the way i pretty much got this set for mandalore the ultimate since this is the only place to find him he is a pretty cool figure especially for kotor fans with the rustic brown clothes and battle he really does look like a more ancient villain than the more modern fetts he has all the points of articulation one could want more importantly his accessories are awesome i already mentioned the battle axe which looks fearsome if you have him swinging it over his head mandalore also comes with a small shield with a strap which you can slip on his arm with all the articulation its pretty easy to set him up in dramatic poses say charging at revan and malak with his battle axe swinging overhead you can probably get mandalore separately via ebay or secondhand but the fetts are pretty good as well if you are looking for some more for your collection|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i purchased this to go with the harley quinn deluxe and the poison ivy deluxe figures from tonner  i admit it was a bit of a disappointment compared to the other two dollsthe doll is quite high quality  a large articulated figure nearly twice the size of a barbie doll and much wider  the outfit is high quality as well  the clothing is layered and made of thick cotton  he comes with a green joker cane with a carved likeness of his head at the topi think the let down is the headface  its a bit too cartoony  scary even  my  year old wont even look at it and she loves the batman comics and animated series  somehow in d relief it comes across as a very disturbing display  unlike the harley and ivy which were created to look like ivy and harley in real life the joker is very cartoony looking its appropriate for the comics but just doesnt feel right when seen in d reliefthe hair is very stiff to hold that molded like shape  so it does stay in place but loses some of the realistic feel in the process unlike harley and ivy who have springy soft hair  jokers comes across as having been plastered hard in place from several cans of hair sprayin all i think this is one of the few regrets of purchases ive made from tonner  if you like your joker scary then likely this figure will greatly please you  as with all tonner dolls hes fully articulated and you can pose him in all kinds of wild and funny ways|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember the excitement when hasbro released this figure in the late s  the first rebel fleet trooper ever the sculpt is still pretty realistic if on the muscular side however there have been better versions including the incredible new  vintage version if you want to get a few rebel fleet troopers id recommend spending your money on those ones first|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|of course when luke first saw the millennium falcon he exclaimed what a piece of junk i had the opposite reaction when i first saw this ship its absolutely gorgeous the sculpt and paint job on the hull are nearly perfect unlike with the older versions hasbro doesnt require you to use decals for the hull so it looks extremely realistic more importantly its huge measuring almost  feet long which is over  larger than either the potf or otc versions while its not quite scale with the typical  figure its not too far off either the falcon comes loaded with lots of other features from the lightup hyperdrive looks great in the dark to a boarding ramp that declines at the press of a buttoni will just make a few recommendations and one area where this nearly perfect vehicle could be improved first it seems a lot of people have complained about the landing gear i havent had a problem so far however you do have to be a bit careful because the instructions arent very clear about how to put them in certain pieces go into certain slots if you do it correctly the landing gear should stay in finesecond the interior of the ship does require decals its not too bad and for the most part theyre easy to apply however if hasbro were ever to redo this ship  not that they have to  id recommend getting rid of the decals altogether and just sculpting and painting the buttons and gear in the interior although im sure thatll be more difficult itd probably look fantasticif you loved star wars loved han and chewie and the millennium falcon this is probably going to be the definitive version of the falcon if you get no other star wars toy in your life make sure its this one you wont be sorry|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i wouldnt say this is a close likeness of the actress in the movie but it is a lovely doll nonetheless  the shirt is nicely stitched and does match the star trek movie costume  the star fleet badge is a separate plastic piece and not just a patch or painted onto the shirt itself  the pattern of the star fleet logo on the dress is painted on rather than a texture  but it doesnt feel to cheap from being so  the undershirt is only a small piece and not a full shirt  it would have been nice for a pink label product to at least have a full undershirt underneath  her boots are solid vinyl and not molded on so they are removable which is a nice touch  she wears small gold earrings and comes with a phaser that is nicely detailedin all a highly recommended collector item that looks just as good outside of the box as in|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a very nice star trek doll though it does suffer in comparison to the kirk and uhura barbies  spocks shirt is nicely deatiled with piping around the edges and the star fleet pattern texture though this is painted on and not a part of the weave  the star trek communicator logo is d and not a patch or painted on item  the military braiding at the cuffs is also nicely detailed looks like braiding and sewn in separately for a more realistic feel though it lacks the texture detail of kirks  the pants are sewn with extra details that specifically match the costume in the movie  they arent just brown pants  the communicator and tricorder are also well done  the molded vinyl boots also carry quite a bit of detailthe dolls likeness to the movie character is fine but perhaps missing some of the directness of the movie character  his hair is very stiff unlike the kirk dolland looks more like a helmet even though it is rooted hair as with the other dolls the undershirt is not separate and just sewn in at the top  i would have liked to see a full undershirt underneathoddest of all the way the hair is stiff and cut makes the ears look rounded  im going to need to take some small trimmers to the hair to make the pointy ears stand out because the doll looks like a human and not a vulcan  i would have liked the ears to stand out away from the head rather than being molded solid against itin all id rate this an excellent dollcharacter  suitable for both boys and girls it definitely doesnt feel like a barbie doll|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a lovely doll for the adult collector  lots of detail sewn into the outfit and a beautiful modern face paint  i love that mattel chose to do a modern gothic line of dolls  sexy and mysteriousas with most of the barbie collector dolls she has solid legs that are not bendable  since shes meant for display and not play thats fine these dolls are meant to be displayed on a stand  but unlike the cheap barbies the legs arent holly and dont knock aroundthe quality of her costume is amazing  she has a raw musline undershirtchemise with lace edging at the collar  the  sleeves are also capped with black lace and delicate ribbons matching the garters on her stockings  a black velvet corset has lovely lace up ribbons that are tied at the top in a bow  i really like that the ribbons are scaleappropriate for the size of the doll  she has a very interesting puffy skirt with tartan details  the skirt is sewn to the musline undershirtbodysuit and not really meant to be removed for play over the outfit is the fourth layer  a red cape with a rolled up hood  interestingly the hood doesnt open  it is rolled and stuffed her hair goes over the top of it  and of course she has the fishnets with lace at the top and redblack shoes  on the inside of her cape is a barbie collector labeli think the only distraction is that the skirt does not fit well on my doll  its too big and bulkyher hair is long in back with a loose curl at the ends  she comes with a basket full of goodies appropriate for a forest rompthe wolf doll is about half the size and equally if not better made  im not a fan of the plastic head  i do wish it was a ken doll with a removable wolf mask  but other than the plastic soft vinyl really head on the wolf i really love this setas with all barbie collector dolls it is intended and priced for the adult collector  and i think the adult collector will love her|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter and i are great fans of the ty beanie boos and part of their charm lies in their big eyes then we came across the aurora plush yoohoo plush toys and were captivated by them as well as a result our collection now covers both the ty beanie boos and aurora yoohoo toys there are differences though they are the same in size and also the big eyes the aurora yoohoos will give out a sound specific to a particular animal when pressed though my daughter loves this feature i prefer the toys to be soundless as the noise gets annoying after a while other than that i think these yoohoo toys are a great complement to the ty beanie boos|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this was actually one of the better barbie toys  after mariposa whose wings never stayed on or worked the elephant from island princess which never caught one of the girls with its trunk and was boring or even princess ro whose peacock feathers never stayed on this seems to be holding up well  and seems to be really enjoyed for beyond a single day by my daughterthe play value is there  if you jiggle the horse in the air it prompts a flying sound there is a little button at the bottom of a hoof so that if you push down on the horse the button is pressed and the horse makes clip clop noises  if you push its mouth open it sounds like it is eating and will eventually make a sound like it doesnt like more and if you leave it alone after playing with it it will make sleeping noises unfortunately as with all barbie toys there is always something that doesnt work  in the case of brushing it with the comb its supposed to make happy noises it doesnt sense when you are combing and my  year old has to yank on the hair to get that particular sound out and i really mean yank  which im not sure i like encouraging her to do to any animal  the horse also randomly plays the connected song and lights up prettilyid highly recommend this toy if only it wasnt so expensive  and lets be honest here there are a lot more toys that might be more interesting or educational than this one and for a lot cheaper  i would expect this to be priced around  to be a decent choice for a good toy value and productand surprisingly i would have liked for better product placement in the video  this character is not in the dvd other than in the background being turned to stone with another horse behind two minor characters  when i bought the horse i had thought there would have at least been a scene in the dvd that my daughter could relate to  but she asks me where is the glimmer horsie in the movie and then asks which of the two horses in the background is glimmer  and i cant tell i had thought one of the main characters would have at least rode or been given the horse  the grapes that it eats seem pretty random  perhaps glimmer is in a book or other story place|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this comes with quite a few little pieces making it perhaps not as fun as other barbie dolls  i really wish mattel would clue in and include some kind of small bag or purse for the doll to carry all her junk in  otherwise these all just end up lost or underfoot all the timeits a lovely doll and the hair is thick and full  but youll probably lose  of the accessories within the first three days|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a nice game that is easy for young ones to play  no dice or counters  just simple memory game and matching  and thats why i rated it at  stars instead of   its just a bit too simplethe game play is simple  you have one set of cards middle layer with dinosaur bone pieces on them  these fit together to assemble  of four dinosaurs you place those face down and then put a top layer larger card on top of each of the them  the top layer cards have little notches in them so you can use the excavator tool to life up the top layer and then secretly peek at a middle layer card  if the piece is for your dinosaur you take that middle layer  if it is someone elses dinosaur part you put it back  you keep going until someone assembles their dinosaur about  cards per dinosaur  there are ruby cards let you take an extra turn and snake cards you flip up an extra top layer and whosoever dinosaur part it is you give to them  the way this works it is much more fun with  players than it is with just   with only two players if someone flips up a middle layer card and its not theirs they put it back and thats an obvious tip off to the other player that the piece is for their dinosaur  which makes it kind of unchallengingi guess the easy way to describe this is that it is similar to a preschool memory game but changed to resemble a dinosaur bone hunt game play takes about  minutes or so and there are a lot of pieces since there are the larger top layer cards and then the smaller middle layer cards  if you lose a card it severely affects the game so you need to be very careful with thisfor educational purposes the back side of the top layer cards all have dinosaur facts  but with only  of those cards those facts get exhausted pretty soon  and with only  dinosaurs to get the bone pieces of theres not a lot of depth of play or learning  each of the dinosaur piece cards is lined by a color making it easy for kids of all ages to know immediately whether the card goes with their dinosaurin all a nice game but definitely for the very young dino lover|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|this is a great kit for fans of fairies and fairy houses the fairy tree house is made of cardboard and so are the little furniture accessories but for the price the quality is reasonably good my first grader saw this at a craft store and begged me to get it for her and we enjoyed assembling the pieces together the fairy house tree house is easy to assemble and is fairly sturdy and able to stand on its own once it is assembled there are not many furniture pieces mainly small pieces of cardboard that folds into a bed sofa table etc but we used many of my daughters little furniture and miniature play food to stand in place and that worked out greatthe real highlight is the making of the fairy dolls they are very easy to make and you can personalize them based on the materials provided different colored yarn for hair various colored flower petals for skirts and the yarn is also used to wrap around the pipe cleaners giving each fairy a distinctive look the detailed stepbystep instructions make this very easy to put together and my daughter was able to make a few fairies on her own with some supervision and assistance from mom we made about six fairies all in different colors and gave them cute namesmy daughter sleeps with this little fairy house on her nightstand and the fairies stay close by too yes we love fairies and our next project is to create fairy houses|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i bought this for my  year old  she has a hard time getting the hands in the right place to make the doll actually do the dancing  i had to read the directions and even then it took a few tries to figure it outits a very vanilla doll  decently presented but perhaps missing a bit of the barbie quality  but for the price it is what it is  i do recommend it for older than  though  my daughter isnt uncoordinated but still has trouble actually making it dance|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|of all the hm singing dolls i like this one best  the styling is quite nice and her hair seems to hold up much better than the other dolls  but as with the other dolls she is quite loud  a nice feature of the jakks hm dolls is that you can press the button again and she stops singing immediately  weve used that feature quite a bitif you only want to get  hm singing dolls this really is your best choice i also like that they didnt have her saying miscellaneous phrases inbetween the song playing oh niblets in a different hm doll is irritating after  times|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|along with the other hannah dolls the clarity of the song is fine and not really too loud or too soft  my  year old loves to dance and sing along with it  shes had a lot of use with it and it hasnt broken|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i would definitely buy this doll at  but she seems a bit high priced above that for what you get  i honestly have tried many different ways to get the dancing feature mechanism to work and honestly all you do is twist the doll oddly and the arms flail  perhaps not the most interest of accessories for a doll as a result  the clothes are bland but serviceableits lacking the charm and quality of a barbie doll  so id rate this as a disposable toy best bought when the price is under  and if your child doesnt have any of the more interesting singing versions|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|ive been playing this with my  year old and we love it  it is much more fun and less frustrating than regular yahtzee  the game is about rolling dice to try to get a card eg  of a kind s etc  or to steal a card that an opponent just won a previous turn if no card is stolenrolled then you use chips to add up they add up fast on harder cards such as  of a kind  making it a trump if you roll a  of a kind on your turn  what makes this fun is that with each roll and each player gets  rolls on their turn you can go for one of the three cards on the board or try to steal an opponents card  so there are very few wasted turns as there are with regular yahtzeealso of note is the beautiful presentation of this game  it has a fancy fold up board that turns into the box bottom  the top is lined in flocked paper so you have a rolling surface that is contained  the board has special holders for your dice from each turn and the storage box is flocked also  even the instructions are beautifully presented in a special die cut fold out  its ironic you cant see just how interesting this is from the outside of the boxin all ive never really liked yahtzee but i greatly enjoyed this game  the presentation and play are first rate fun and it is something that is good for a wide range of ages eg if you have a family of  of different ages they can all play together equally with no advantage for someone being older|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ive always been a fan of the mon calamari the tartakovsky clone wars had a brief segment about the battle for mon cala it was short and in some ways a bizarre interpretation of life on that world with shirtless quarren and mon calamari who use primitive crustaceanshaped weapons however as with much of tartakovskys star wars it had some stark visual imagery the mon cal soldiers had a very organic feel to themthis figure represents tartakovskys vision well the figure surprisingly isnt a rehash of the potf admiral ackbar figure the head is new and the feat are also new  incidentally the first time weve ever seen mon cal feet the accessories are very detailed and the mon cal can hold them all very well although they could have used a bit more weathering or variation in the paint scheme my only small nitpick about the figure is that the arm articulation is limited while the joints are there the range of motion is limited by the placement of the joints its really not a big deal for an otherwise excellent figure|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of my least favorites in the dolls of the world series  her dress is a very cheap satin and the detailing is not nearly as nice as other dolls the lace is the cheap stuff you find on underwear the hat is especially cheap looking and poor quality and the dress is not full as the box makes it look  in fact theres nothing under the cheap satin of the dress at all so it looks really flat right out of the box  in fact it comes out of the box perfectly folded in half and never really fluffs out at all  the dress is made to be permanently uplifted  it would have been nice if it could have been made such that it looked like she was actually flipping it upwards rather than having it illogically defy gravity on its ownthe doll herself is quite lovely and the hair is nicely styled  the shoes and stockings are also nice  one benefit of taking it out of the box is that her feather can stand up to full height and add to the costume  but honestly i dont like looking at this doll much because her outfit and especially the hat look so cheaply made and designedone complaint is that the satin of the dress is so cheap that the tabs used to hold it into place in the box are permanently molded into the back of the dress  looks bad from the backin all definitely not one of the better barbies in the pink label line|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|of course hasbro came out with dark empire figures in the late s if youre a fan of the comics those were great figures and definitely worth picking up in some ways i think the color schemes on those figures were more faithful to the rich yet dark colors of the comics yet its nice to see hasbro issue more dark empire figures with different interpretations of the characters these are totally new figures these two figures sure beat their s counterparts when it comes to their clothes lukes flowing robes capture a sense of power and majesty lukes face looks more mature and pained than most luke figures which is exactly as it should be the emperor has fabric robes that flow nicely also he has lightning that fits well on his hand this emperor is pale to the point of being white with the idea being that he just transferred to one of his new clones overall this isnt a substitute for the previous figures but its sure nice to get them if you have fond memories of reading the comics|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i bought this figure as part of the capture of the droids multipack figures in the clone wars collection are well sculpted and have fair articulation just short of vintage style figures their purpose is to be fun first collectable second  even as cpo is not as fun as other figures in the clone war collection it would be a shame to let it passcpos figure is a big leap from the  jointed version sold  years agothis figure has balljointed neck ballhinged shoulders elbows torso and ankles and swivel wrists hips and kneesthis version is not shinny but is still painted golden albeit a bit darker this figure lacks accessories but it has a cool special feature its eyes glow when i shine a light on the back of his headoverall this figure has great likeness to the animated version and posability of any cpo|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|im so glad that theyre finally making more figures from the star wars expanded universe particularly timothy zahnsheir to the empireseries the borsk feylya is one of the best recent figures ive seen it looks great well painted and articulated unlike some of the more modern figures the points of articulation are very well hidden and dont stick out senator feylya is one of the most important characters from the expanded universe and its nice to see him immortalized in plasticthe only drawback with this pack is the wedge figure not that its bad  its actually a unique version of wedge outside of his flight suit however hes just not as exciting as the good senator  id have preferred borsk feylya be packaged with another thrawn trilogy character also the articulation points on wedges arms really stick out because the white color of his tunic doesnt really hid the jointsoverall this pack is worth getting just for borsk feylya wedge is a decent bonus but doesnt make or break the set|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|these are great pool toys  ive found theyre perfect for helping kids practice swimming  first use them as floating targets that kids can swim to then swim back to the shallow end or wall  then when kids are ready to start putting their face in the water suspend them under water but still floating  finally when kids are comfortable enough it allows them to practice diving to retrieve these submergibles off the bottom of the pool  theyre easy to see and grab too which is an added bonus|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this was honestly a great idea for a doll but perhaps not the best realization  the accuracy of the tattoos is quite good down to goldies fingers being very long and slighly skewed at her waist  it feels like it was designed from a real woman  but the hair is quite stiff oddly cut and perhaps a bit to difficult to make a doll look like the actual model  her face also feels very barbie and makes goldie look vapid rather than impish  the doll especially suffers when you remove her from the box  the back of the hair is flattened from the box and since it was so stiff it looks odd when the doll is displayed  the doll really loses a lot of charm when removed from the boxanother detractor is that she is not posable  her legs and arms are quite stiff  i think i would have liked this a lot more if i could have put her in some fun period poses  rather than having to rely on the same one all the timein all i do regret a bit that i purchased the doll  the likeness isnt very close she isnt posable and her hair is a true mess|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the talking railway series features train pieces such as cranky and a waterton station that have sir topham hatt talk to each train when they are close to that piece  for example sir topham hatt will say toby cranky is ready to load the cargo when toby rolls over the track by cranky  my  year old loves it without noticing the technology behind the sets ability to recognize and speak to each individual engine as he moves them around the tracksemily is a great addition to the set as she is the only female engine from the main  engines from the series  the sets revolve around the feature the great discovery the feature in which thomas goes wandering and discovers the long lost town of waterton which sir topham hatt rebuilds  one of the set pieces is the mine which thomas falls intonote that emily herself doesnt talk  shes part of the talking railway series that recognizes her and talks to her  this can get confusing because there are wooden engines out there that do talk  talking thomas talking james and talking percy for example not to be confused with talking railway thomas talking railway james and talking railway percy  talking james takes one aa battery and says three different things when you press a button on top of his cabin and makes his whistle soundso just realize when purchasing this item that you wont get the maximum benefit unless you own one of the pieces from the talking railway series brendam dockscranky brendam barrel company morgans mine talking railway knapford station talking railway oval set and waterton station  these can be added on to your regular wooden thomas sets and youll find that emily and the other engines are the same high quality as the regular wooden sets|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we put this and the table on our amazon wish list because its honestly something in a price range that wasnt in our budget  we have come to expect high quality from thomas wooden train setsit has two sides as mentioned which makes it more fun  we have several different sized thomas and friends trainswooden trackmaster take and play and mega blocks  the take and play trains are too small but the wooden and trackmaster trains fit  the trackmaster motorized trains will only go around the outside track while motorized and cant corner the tight corners if you start it off on the inside tracks  of course they arent meant for this board so thats not really all that importantthe boards fit easily into the table but not snugly so there is a little bit of give if you move it  that give means that sometimes the two boards dont align perfectly and our three year old has problems crossing from one board to the other  there are many different ways that we can address this including inserting a small piece of wood along the side to keep it snug so this really isnt a problemboth sides are vividly colorful and help us narrate tales of sodor for our son  the flat side allows us to do a lot with the table outside of putting his wooden sets there  and thankfully all of his various wooden engines get parked along the sidelines and not all over my house happy momwe already have a small scratch on the board so the durability  finish isnt spectacular so we are hoping that it doesnt show too much wear as the resale value of these tables is extremely high board and table set never go for less than  in our area on craigslist  it doesnt seem worth the price but then again all of the thomas wooden train elements are prohibitive|ham

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|this set looks very attractive and i had already purchased some of the other smaller playsets so i deliberated on whether to purchase this or not my daughter loves strawberry shortcake and her friends and would make a beeline for this toy every time we went to the store during one of my daughters playdates her friend had this set and after observing them at play and also after handling these toys for a while i decided against buying it the main reason is the tiny accessories that comes with this playset  the food items etc are miniscule and can be easily misplaced my common complaint with the accessories in the strawberry shortcake playsets i can foresee this being a problem in households where there are younger siblings below the age of three as they could be a potential choking hazard also the berry cafe is not very substantial for the price  there is no back cover it would have been more attractive and practical if it were the kind of building that could open and close and perhaps have a little handle on top to make for easy carrying all in all i found this playset overpriced and not practical|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i always regretted not having found these when they first came out in the late s i finally tracked them down for a reasonable price i like both ships the space jockey ship is actually pretty detailed for a toy of this size it looks a bit too shiny for the ship but of course it was dark in the movie i always saw the ship as more reddish than bluish the armored personnel carrrier looks good as well the two guns swivel the apc is also close to scale size with the action fleet drop ship the two figures are decent about the size of action fleet figures so if you have those aliens action fleet ships these figures are a nice addition but if you dont have the action fleet ships and those were rare then the figures are just kind of extra id have preferred another ship overall if you can track this down its a nice treat for aliens fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|a lot of reviewers seem to be giving this figure a low rating because its april and well lets be honest april was never the most exciting tmnt figure however that aside this is actually a pretty good figure the figure captures the look and spirit of the original comic april she looks pretty although her facial features look comic not realistic also as an added bonus she comes with two mouser figures one of which has a mouth that opens given that neca sold a set of three mousers whose mouths couldnt open alone for more than the price of this figure id say this is a great deal|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a very faithful reproduction of the original doll  its not a redo  the quality of the clothing sculpt even feel of the doll is very much as it would have been in   she comes with a complete white leisure suit hair pick and accessories and memorabilia book and cardsi was pleased with my purchase and did debox her  the only detraction for me was that her hair was a bit messy out of the box and not a clean afro  but i am going to assume that the original doll had the same type of hair|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|neca did an incredible job with these figures the detailing is extremely realistic if you rub your finger along the body it feels like rough wrinkled skin neca also managed to get quite a bit of articulation including wrist leg elbow shoulder and two neck joints one at the base and one near the head et is around  inches tall but hes a pretty bulky figure and looks quite largethe galactic friend figure comes with a wraparound towel the towel is moulded not cloth so you can really only dress et up in it one way however it looks great on him it can be removed to get a naked version of et one warning with the towel is that at a few points some of the white paint rubbed onto the figure i was initially pretty upset but i noticed that just rubbing those spots with a wet cloth completely removed the white paint and solved the problemthis figure also comes with a neck extension so you can make the neck longer it looks great although admittedly is a bit tough to get on you have to position the ball in the ball socket straight so you can push it in my advice is to just switch to the longer neck and leave itmy only complaint is that the small reeses pieces accessory doesnt have a label its just an orange bag of candy the trademark was probably left off for legal reasons still thats a pretty small complaintthe dress up figure comes with moulded hair dress and a mink scarf just like from the scene in the movie he also comes with a small bag that you can take off the clothes and hair are not to my knowledge removable they seem glued on although in theory you could probably rip them off and still have the base figurethe thing i love most about this figure is the face rather than simply using the same head as the galactic friend figure this ets face has a very concernedpuzzled look just like in the movie the mouth looks a bit scrunched up and the upper lip starting to frown as opposed to the other et figures smile its awesome that neca took the time and effort to add that amount of detailit took  years but finally we have an et figure worth of the film well worth the price|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|who doesnt love a vuvuzela  i really like these compared to other noise makers since they actually take some finesse to get a good sound out of it  anyone who has ever carried one of these around knows how much of a pain it is  this collapsible one is fantastic  i still get a really loud sound out of it and its a lot easier to bring to sporting events than the standard onesnote if you havent played a vuvuzela before you need to buzz your lips together in order to make a sound just like any horn  it may take a few tries but dont give up  you too can irritate friends and soon to be enemies|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|finally an updated nien nunb the last time we had this character was during the old potf line this time hes in a bwing bomber suit its not entirely clear nien nunb ever wore a bwing suit in the film but there is a sullustan in the rebel briefing scene so i guess hasbro decided it was nien nunb regardless this is a solid figure the face is a pale peach color perfect for the sullustan race in fact its a more realistic tone than what we saw in the movie the pilot suit comes with dangling hoses and straps which really makes it come to life of course the helmet comes off allowing you to see his whole face overall one of the better rebel pilot figures i hope hasbro makes a vintagestyle nien nunb in his smugglers gear|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my  year old son resists taking a bath like crazy so anything that entices him into it is great  every time we call for a bath we then face the struggle of getting him to leave his thomas trains which usually means they get to sit on the floor by the bathtub while hes in the bath  so i was very happy to get this thomas and bulstrode bath setthe boat is made of plastic and does have holes on top so it does fill with water as he plays with it and ends up at the bottom of the bathtub  however he knows to take it out and hold it upside down to empty it and start again  what are little engineers for  keeping busy fixing things of coursethe little attached boat is cute and the propulsion just a fun extra to keep him interested  its thomas who is the main action  the perimeter of the tub becomes the track and thomas goes around and around until he falls into the water and has to be saved  the thomas squirter is a little difficult for him to use at his age he doesnt understand leaving it under the water to fill up very slowly and then cant shoot the water out unless he holds it upside down mama water is coming out of thomas funnel  but he works it out  if it was too easy would he keep playing with it  maybe not and the downsides arent ones that make him frustrated such as train cars that dont stay connectedi know the top is there and can serve as a scoop to play with the water but i wish it was attached  he doesnt ever play with it and the water and just ends up putting it back on when he empties the water out of the boathe has fun with it and thats what counts and for under  i get a  year old who is willing to get into and stay in the bathtub|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we have the thomas trackmaster set zip zoom and logging adventure  it features the fun logging area from the misty island rescue movie complete with a fallen tree tunnel and a zipline which my  year old loves  he loves to play with his thomas trains on the logging adventure set manually and only every once in a while turns on the motorized thomaswe just got this remote control thomas from amazon and it gives a whole new dimension to our already fun track set  we i say we since its fun for the adults too love having control over thomas moving through the tracks going backwards and forwards with the sounds of chugging when you move the throttle forwards and the sounds of reversing train when you move the throttle backwardsnot only that but you have two buttons one with the authentic thomas whistle sound and one with music  he absolutely loves it  all he needs now is an engineer hati highly recommend both the logging adventure set and the remote control thomas for great family funyou also dont have to use thomas on the tracks  although you cant steer thomas its still fun to start him out down a hallway and chug along  i think this is another candidate for something to bring at boring kids places like the crafts store we go to  the thomas engine and car dont disconnect so we dont have to contend with the decoupling frustration he gets with other thomas  car setsit is a tad loud  we had his grandparents on skype in england and we couldnt continue the conversation while sounding the buttons  but its not annoyingly loud  it really adds an air of funstock up on  aaa batteries|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i dont going to lie  i got this collectible tin because of ventress plain and simple  i could have chosenclone wars battle pack jedi showdown but for about the same price i got a nice tin that makes showing your figures in the box more appealing  this clone wars collectible tin includes count dooku asajj ventress obiwan kenobi and captain rexcount dooku is not a bad figure but there is a better one indooku with speeder bike set  however this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders and elbows swivel wrists waist and hips but no articulation on the knees or ankles  the sculpt and paint of this figure is very accurate to the animated series even the a plastic cape looks great i prefer fabric for this kind of accessories but i can appreciate the benefits of a well sculpted plastic version in addition the right hand can be swapped with one with force lighting effects coming out of the fingers articulation on the knees and ankles would have put this figure over the top  this figure also includes a red lightsaber and an hologram of ventressof course this is the figure that i was looking for assajj ventress  this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders knees and ankles swivel forearms waist and hips but no articulation on the elbows  the sculpt and paint of this figure is spoton ventress from the cg animated series hasbro got this figure right to top it off this figure includes a fabric skirt that is removable the only thing that could be seen as a minus is the lack of actual articulation on the elbows  however it would have been very difficult to put ballhinged on such tiny elbows and still make it look good i think they did the right call  this figure also includes two red lightsabers and an hologram of count dookuobiwan is a good figure but there is a better one in theobiwan and freeco bike  however this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders and elbows swivel wrists waist and hips but no articulation on the knees or ankles  this figure sports a good sculpt and paint job but the limited articulation on the legs hinders the figure however it includes a swapable head to show the character with a helmet and a removable back pack that can launch a missile which add a lot of play value  and of course this figure also includes a blue lightsaberfinally there is captain rex  this is a great figure but if you own one with phase i armor chances are that it is this one  this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hips  the sculpt and paint on this figure are really good but the most impressive part is its articulation as it should for a true action figure like this one its helmet and pauldron is removable and the holster fit its two blastersi thought that if the box was too old or the tin too dent i would have opened these figure  specially ventress  however my gamble pay off too well as i dont have an excuse to open this set|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a nice set in that it has complete dresses and not mix and match pieces that get lost easily  the material for the dresses is on the thin side even for barbie standards but the outfits are at least not as tacky as some that mattel has put out this year  one thing i dont like is that the designs on the front never continue to the back you cant see that when they are in the box of course  the gold dress in this set for example has the belt and tie on the front  but the belt and tie stop at the side seams and the back is plainim rating this a  star because this is a classier set than many of the alternative fashion sets this year|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the outfits here are nice and have a bit of diversity  but they seem like a lot of little pieces top here skirt there boa there purse here that dont really add up to a concrete set of  looks  because there isnt much too them it makes them easy to get on and off a doll for a young girl  i just wish there was more to them since the pieces get mixed in with other clothes  younger girls seem to like to have just one dress rather than little pieces of other dresses to put together|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i think mattel must have stayed true to the original  but for the modern collector it may be a bit off to have a doll with big clumsy boots and gloves clumpy formless suit and giant plastic dome  the hair is stiff and not really moldable  it seems like something best left in the box  the flag looks like one of those c party cocktail toothpick decorationsin all this was my least favorite in the barbie career dolls  feels like a better concept than actual reality|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i was really glad i chose this one of the barbie basics  she has a sweet face a beautiful smile and i like that her face is more rounded and healthier looking than the other model dolls  shes more beautiful and fun girl next door than she is haute couture model  her hair is quite lovely out of the box and she looks very good from all angles when displayed  i especially like how open and friendly she feels  as if she has a personality and isnt just a random molded doll with typical pretty features|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the costars of the barbie movies never seem to get much care  they arent given the characters names or likenesses not even close and the quality usually falls greatly off from the main character  honestly they feel kind of pointless theres not a lot of play value if the dolls dont look like the ones who talk to merliah in the movie and certainly their quality doesnt compare to merliahthis doll has a hard plastic hollow body that feels cheap and doesnt bend  the tail rotates on the base and the body bends forward  but the body has a bathing suit that doesnt match the tail and looks kind of dumb when the doll is sitting the arms and chest are also stiff plastic that just feels cheap  the face is very generic barbie dollthe doll is inexpensive and thats really the only redeeming feature  but for twice the price i really recommend the mattel barbie splash and style meraids  they have rubber bodies and tails that twist and bend httpwwwamazoncombarbiesplashstylemermaidangeldpbetfurefsr  ieutfstoysandgamesqidsr  since the co stars are generic and not tied into the movie anyway might as well get a mermaid that feels and looks goodin all i dont recommend getting this because of the dvd  it doesnt appear in the movie and doesnt look like the costars  its fine as a generic inexpensive fairy doll|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of  destinies from the movie a mermaid tale  of the three this wasnt the head destiny and was more of a supporting character  if you are trying to decide on which destiny to buy i would recommend the pink one in the jeans over the purple and blue ones  the pink destiny most resembles the movie character and had the most lines in the movie  the blue and purple ones did not do much at all in the movie  or as a dollthese are smaller than a barbie doll even though the destinies were full barbie size in the movie and made of hard plastic  they dont move at all and arent posable the sea horses come with a little stand on their back and the destiny doll clips into it loosely  which can be problematic  they arent very useful out of the water since they dont stand at all and certainly they dont float right in the watersince this purple destiny doesnt resemble the character in the movie isnt posable doesnt sit right falls out of the saddle easily and doesnt allow for you to change her clothes i dont rate this highly if your daughter really wants the destinies i would get the pink one only and be done with it|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been ig is a pretty minor figure to even have a concept art figure nonetheless of all the concept art figures thus far he differs most from the final version this ig is fat instead of thin he isnt very exciting and i like the final version a lot better the figure itself is very detailed and highly articulable however he isnt really playable so i recommend this one only for collectors|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|although this set has a minimum recommended age of  we got it for our  year old because he loves the junkyard escape in toy story  and were willing to always play with him  we put this set together quickly using the easy picture instructions  the only challenging piece was the crane  it says to turn in counter clockwise once until it clicks but no matter how we turned it it didnt click and sometimes just started the turning action  it also doesnt stay very well when you pull the claw string back to attach itthe goodthis set has an amazing price  we were very surprised at the value  toy story  figurines by themselves start adding up and you get three with this setwoody lotso and an alien add in the dump truck that has retractable connectors so your child can drive it around and youre getting close to the price youd think youd pay  but theres so much morewe knew that our son would have a challenge doing the whole stunt sequence so after we ran it a couple of times for him we simply unsnapped the parts and let him play with them individually  he had a lot of fun with the claw mommy the claw saves them from the fire and with sending woody down the conveyor belt you wind up the conveyor belt and woody is carried to the end and dumped offour son put lotso on top of the box stunt piece and said the bad bear isnt going to press the button and hed have lotso scurry off  you would think hed have problems with things falling over but he didnt they stand alone pretty well  he liked storing the alien in the trash truck and driving off saying the trash truck is taking the alienwe have three other sets and we look forward to setting up a big chain reaction for our son  we figure that he will have fun for a few weeks playing with the individual parts then well hide the stunt sets for a while and bring them out when hes old enough to have lots of fun running the stunt show himselfthe badi almost wish woody had a stand because he doesnt stand independently on the conveyor belt you have to lay him down  lotso and the alien go down just fine thoughwhen setting up the full chain reaction you do find that you start partial sequences accidentally which means you have to start over  the bright side of that however is that you know each section trigger is sensitive enough that its going to keep working welli mentioned the down sides of the claw already but should say that he loves it anyway and likes to put characters in the claw to be carriedits really cute and our son really enjoys acting out and improvising the scenes from the movie and that means this is a superb buy for us at this price  not sure how frustrating the set would be if he were  and trying to set up the sequence though|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we got this for our  year old toy story fanatic  the minimum specified age is  but we knew hed love this set and we only let him play with it with us there  there were some strange warnings on amazon about choking parts and a marble and balloons but there is no marble nor balloons so were not sure what that was aboutthe andy play sequence at the beginning of the movie is his favorite and he has a dr evil pig spaceship and a train rescue set of figures as well  the thing i most appreciate about this set woody can actually ride bullseye  every other set out there that has a bullseye does not come with a character that sits on him  when you put woody on him he stays and even has cute ribbon reins  also theyre sturdy and dont fall overthe goodvery nice attractive plastic train set with many built in options for changing things up  the engine has cute rodcrank action on the wheels and the caboose has an easy press latch to send things flying  that and the caboose has a great little carry section on the back so that woody or bullseye can ride at the back of the train  our son is only  so we dont let him use the launcher on the nd car it has engine two cars and caboosehe opened a lot of other presents besides this one but this is the one he chose to play with all day  hes been all over the house with it all the while excitedly talking about moments in the movie or saying things like the train is going too fast dont fall off woodyincredibly fast setup  my husband had it ready in about  minutesthe okif my son takes the train on the rugs the cars become decoupled  its a simple peg and hole coupling and he has difficulty hooking them up so he gets frustrated when they come apart which happens if he goes on an uneven surface like going from hardwood floor to rug  if he were  i think hed be fine hooking and unhooking the cars so this may be a good case for waiting until your child is the recommended minimum age on the boxthe pictures show woody getting launched off the roof of the caboose but honestly woodys feet are tiny and the slightest movement makes him fall over  so he doesnt launch off the caboose well but i can attest that lots of other things dotrain sets out there are pricey so this was a great value especially at the amazon pricingalso this toy has great longevity because of the additional functionality  right now its just a train that woody and bullseye chase and ride but i expect that later he will have lots of fun reassembling the mega rig and doing some woody action scenes like using the launcher|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we bought this set a double curved set and one other switch piece on amazon from this vendor  the pieces all arrived in bubble packaging with each set in a zip sealed bag my  year old went crazy when he saw the pieces and he ran to his thomas train table and started building with them immediately my husband and i really loved watching him so excited but so concentrated biting his lip as he figured out how to use these pieces hed only had straight curved and bridge track before these pieces have expanded his track building universe in a rewardingly educational waythe thomasbranded wooden track is so expensive and the switch tracks rare  this is an affordable way to expand your track and it fits thomas sets flawlessly|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we started with a figure  thomas wooden coal track set and got expansion track sets  the thomas wooden branded track sets can be very expensive though and you can end up paying two dollars per track piece not only that but there are very few switch track piecestherefore i started looking into nonthomas branded tracks and was very happy to find this  at this low price you get two double curved switch tracks which gives you some great flexibility for expansion and fun i hoped they were true to their word that it fit thomas sets and they do very wellmy  year old had started out as just a conductor preferring to just move his trains around the tracks that we built about a month ago he started building his own tracks and loves to rebuild them every few days  these two pieces have given him so many more interesting options  he has been very excited to build with these though the complexity level has increased and he sometimes needs our help  but that is a wonderful thing  hes learning to deal with a higher level of complexity and thus learning from new challengesthe only down side is that he broke off one of the couplings within a few days  i dont blame the manufacturer  he was making a track and had already coupled this piece and was pulling it extremely taut to try to connect the track further down the line  i dont think any track could have withstood that the couplings on these seem the exact same as thomas tracks  with a little wood glue it was all fixed  that is the joy of wood track|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|i remember one of my friends having a similar barbie styling head when we were little  it was a really nice one at the time but this one puts it to shame  the older versions you just have the option of brushing and styling barbies hair and doing her make up  i love that this version had hands too  you get to do barbies nails too  great for little kids who enjoy playing dress up|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the doll itself is comparable in quality to the other dolls in the dvd line  the dress is two layered she has fashioned high top sneakers eyeglasses that will undoubtedly go missing after one day and a plastic dog companion  unlike the pink barbie character the doll has no special features  she doesnt sing twirl light up dance or even move interestingly  as such shes a very vanilla doll and lacking the interest that the other companion dolls received in previous moviesalso note that her legs are hollow hard plastic and dont bend neither do her arms  so she isnt posableon the plus side since she is vanilla she is cheaper than her barbie companion which has a light up dress  so for girls who like to reenact the movie shes a great accessory for the barbie character  but youll definitely want to get the barbie character before this one|ham

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i purchased this for my daughters sixth birthday shes a fan of polly pocket dolls and was delighted to find that this set comes not only with six dolls but that one of them is a male polly pocket they are so hard to come by and we finally have one in our collection there are lots of pieces in this set more than  wow and features dolls from the yummy water and electropop worldsthe two mermaid polly pockets come with accessories that match the water theme similarly the boy and girl polly pocket from the electropop theme come with clothing and accessories the two dolls from the yummy theme have a little picnic table with delightful confections to match this is a worthwhile gift set for children who love the polly pocket dolls|spam
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i got this for my daughters sixth birthday we went with a polly pocket theme and she loved that this doll came with so many clothes  there are shorts culottes pants dresses tops shoes etc my daughter was happy to be able to dress her other polly dolls in these outfits too we store all of the polly accessories in a separate container with handle so that we can carry them around easily and prevent these tiny pieces from getting lost though over the years we have lost quite a few of the polly accessories the dolls are kept in another separate container the clothes can at times be difficult to put on the dolls but careful sliding usually helps|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a cute set but with the sheer amount of small pieces i have to wonder if it is really worth the msrp  you get  polly pockets and a whole slew of accessories  it looks impressive in the packaging but when you take them out you end up with a sandwich bag size of items  most not really that interesting or usable to the set   pieces sounds impressive until you realize that most will be lost stepped on or just plain not interesting enough to be used plus if you have toddlers youll have to watch the choking hazard when the older kids play with the setsin all my daughter did like the set but only played with the figures and the larger pieces  and one of the mermaids had a hand break off on the very first day  surprising both of usthis was our first polly pocket set and perhaps we just didnt find it as interesting as we thought we would|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we received this as a present and liked that the hair grows and it has playability  its clear a lot of the production money must have been spent on having the longer grow hair than on the dress or accessories  the dress itself is the very plain cheap satin with very little in the way of interest in it  but the doll serves the purpose of looking like the movie character though missing the charm and personality  i like that you can store the accessories in the brush so they wont get lost as easilythis version is far superior to the rapunzel doll that comes with extra hair on a clip  that one feels really cheap  id highly recommend this oneif you want to get a really nice one there is a  same size disney version that looks much closer to the movie character and has more interesting hair more like the curly mess of the movie character|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|a friend purchased this for my daughter as a playdate treat some time ago and my daughter had great fun with it the kit works well but i would advise parental supervision for younger children  if only because the plastic machine for making the foil beads is not exactly high quality and may break easily if too much pressure is applied the set comes with  pieces of foil in four bright colors  these pieces need to be folded properly before being inserted into the bead maker so once again parental supervision or aid might be required at least until the child gets the hang of ittheres really no complexity to this kit except perhaps in folding the foil sheets properly and after its loaded into the bead maker all one needs to do is crank it until the foil is pressed together and voila a bead is made the instructions are userfriendly and all in all this is a fun craft kit i was so impressed at how easy and fun it was that i bought a set for my daughters friends th birthday|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this does have some drawbacks but it is good solid fun for young kids  it plays two tunes my little pony theme and a caribbean theme has castle horn sounds and has a rotating swing set at the top of the castle  it also lights up  all are controlled with the same single button  so you will have to push multiple times if you want to eg move the rotating swingsbut it has some heavy drawbacks that could very much frustrate younger kids  ponies are top heavy with the tail and fall over easily  whether in the set or on their own  nor do they really sit in anything easily  although they have the hole in the bottom to help keep them on pegs on various items on the playset they dont stay in the pegs and fall over easily  not even i as the parent could get them to stay  i could barely get them to stand on their own  and well they have hollow arms which is kind of disturbing actually  the seal that comes with the set has a peg hole in the bottom so he will stay on items  however if you buy the companion ponies and their friends separately eg the one with the dolphin the friends do not have pegs  we bought the pony with the dolphin and the dolphin doesnt sit in anywhere  he just flops over stupidly  if you put the ponies in the rotating swings they tend to flop over and block the thing from working catch on a piece of the castle  the set makes horrible noises when that happens  the shell sits in a peg and is very stiff to open  trying to pry it open usually results in knocking it off of the peg which frustrates my  year oldi have a very patient kid and she becomes easily frustrated with this set  things dont stay in place fall off dont work or arent compatible with all accessories etc  but it does have good play value in that it moves plays music etc|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the cloud car isnt one of the most popular vehicles but it has its fans fortunately theyll be quite pleased with this new cloud car the last time hasbro released a toy cloud car was   almost  years ago this one is quite a looker its a simply vehicle but hasbro took the time to make it well and it shows the most important thing is that there are absolutely no decals hasbro either painted or sculpted all features including the controls inside the cockpit also while hasbro usually decides to ruin its star wars vehicles by adding on firing missiles and other play features hasbro treated the cloud car a bit more respectfully probably because it realized collectors would be the ones who primarily bought this vehicle the cloud car does have a few firing missiles for the kids but theyre discretely hidden within the pods of each car the missile launchers only appear if you push the cars closer together in other words if you just want a movieaccurate model of the cloud car you never have to see the missile launchers  just pretend they dont exist the one tiny complaint i have is the landing gear it sticks out a bit when put up it seems like there should have been a way to make it a bit less obtrusive its not a problem from most angles but still overall this is an awesome vehicle with a few features for the kids but high quality for collectors|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i really like that scrabble has been updated with modern technology scrabble dates back to the s after alland so a whole new twist on the game can be played theres no board now  just electronic tiles  players have  seconds to shuffle and slide their electronic cubes to create words before the time runs out each of the five scrabble flash cubes letter tiles has smart tile technology so that each one recognizes the letters placed next to it and automatically keeps score and checks if the word is spelled correctlywhile traditional scrabble fans will probably stick with the board game since a lot of the board strategies are no longer valid with scrabble flash such as leftover tile strategies and doubletriple word score challenges scrabble flash game is great for casual play  it provides a way for families to play together with several challenges aimed directly for family play and parents can work on ways to make it age appropriate for all family members eg under  need only to get  letter words  have to get  letter words and  have to get  letter wordsthe game also provides a nice outlet for solitaire play  something the board game doesnt do that well  you dont need a computer to challenge yourself any longerthese use coin sized lithium batteries and dont look to use too much power so id expect them to go a long time before you have to replace the batteriesin all a very cool update of scrabble that is very portable and suitable for scrabble enthusiasts as well as the casual family players|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the weebles treehouse is cute simple and entertaining i got it for a month old niece but my year old niece saw it and really liked it im not quite sure why but this was a big hit with both girls it seems kids anywhere in that range could have fun with it its pretty safe has no small parts and is easy for toddlers to operate even the crank is fairly easy i appreciated the color scheme with lots of bright greens yellows and reds and needless to say its a big toy  much bigger than it looks in the picture  which is always exciting for kids id definitely recommend this set especially if your toddlers already have weebles|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i want to start the review by saying i love that playskool redesigned the weebles back to being eggs with paper inserts of faces i had grown up with weebles as my favorite toy and was disappointed when my daughter was born a few years ago and the weebles no longer looked like weebles  they were plastic figures with a round bottom  but now they are back to being the fun little eggs that little ones like to push and roll and the expressions on the faces can be that much more funalso important to note is that this is a large set  much bigger than it looks in the picture  but it is also compact for storage  its tall and not wide so you dont take up floor roomour  year old went nuts over this  the bright colors play areas working knobs and little hiding places for the figures  he had no problem with the crank and getting the weebles to go up the stairs  and of course when they slide down and triggered the songs he would dance along with them proudlyanother favorite way to play with the toy was that he would put them inside the tree home and play house  wed get to knock on the door to see if they were home or hed push the button to play music for them  in all the tree house kept him entertained for hours on end  he didnt want to go to sleepthe tree house has a large crank that brings the weebles up the stairs  at the top they automically slide down the slide and end up at the bottom of the stairs again  when they hit the bottom they trigger the music to play a little ditty  theres also a little hang out at the top of the tree and a home inside the base of the tree  in all quite a bit of play areas in a compact size  perfect for little ones and with few pieces to losebut best of all the weebles are back to the original designs of the s  just larger sized for safety|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the tonner harley quinn doll stands nearly twice as high as a regular barbie doll and is proportionately thicker  the materials for her costume are all very well made  cloth stretch leotard crip ruffed wrists stuffed justers hat and soft pompom details at the neckthe doll comes with long blonde hair that comes out from the back of the costume  so she is not really displayable from the side easily  but it means you can fold back the hat and remove the mask to get the blonde harlene quinzel figure to show from beneath the evil costumethe face has a nice sculpt and she has greyish eyes on white porcelain skin  the mask shoes gloves and rest of the accoutrements are removable  giving you a lot of ways to pose her  she doesnt come with any accessories which admittedly takes away a bit from the lunatic harley flavor  she now just looks determined rather than bat crazythe cinched waist bustier and shiney leatherette boots are admittedly detractions  they just dont sit right with the rest of the harley quinn outfit perhaps a bit too sexy for the ingenue personality  if i had to describe this doll it would be harley in  years after the batman animated series  shes older and she means businessin all the size and articulation make this a great purchase  no one will confuse her with a barbie doll and you can make your own props to give her a bit of flair  i definitely dont regret the purchase and my  year old daughter who loves the show gives it a high thumbs up as a display piece as well|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|i realize that most people buy these star wars sets to have as collectibles and unfortunately most of them are engineered that way not so with this ship  it stays together very well and takes about  hours for an experienced lego builder to assemble  the sliding cockpit and flick missiles are always neat features on these ships and this one doesnt disappoint  of course you have to buy this set to get general grevious since hes so collectible but his ship is designed well enough so that it doesnt colllapse as do many of the other lego star wars sets especially slave i  dont be afraid to buy this one and actually get some playtime out of it  it will hold up after you make sure the cockpit area is secured well  the flat plates on the bottom of the ship are key to keeping this guy together so i sincerely recommend that you provide assitance if buying this for an inexperienced prelego afficionado  other than that highly recommend|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|im not really a fan of the twilight movie so dont really have a vested interest in jacob or edward  but even i was quite impressed with how well done this doll isjacob is fully articulated  you can pose him in as many ways as you like  and he is quite large  nearly twice the size of a barbie and quite wider  no one will confuse this with a little girl toy at that sizehis clothes are quality made but what really makes the doll is the face sculpt its been awhile since ive seen such a faithful adaptation from movie star to dollfigure  but this doll could almost live and breathe it feels so real  the size and proportions are all correct to the star who plays jacob and the hair is even quite well donein all if you know a jacob fan this is perhaps the very best twilight item you can buy them  ive shown it to friends who have literally gasped at the likeness and quality of the doll  and what a display piece considering he can be posed in so many waysthis doll did win one or more awards and when you see it in person youll understand why  highly recommended|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|as others have noted it was very disappointing to open the box and find out that this is not a barbie doll so much as a barbie shaped music player  she doesnt bend pose or move  her legs are cheap and hollow from the knee down but above the knee they are connected to one giant music player box  that plays one tune onlythe on button is her belt but that shifts around since it is on her dress  so it can be hard to get it to play at timesyou cant put fashions on herremove her dress which is the most disappointing  what little girl doesnt want to changetake off the dresses of her barbiesthis is in stark contrast to the other singing barbies from previous movies  they all sang by pushing a button in the back or chest and there were no clumsy boxes between the legs  you could easily change dresses or pose them as a result we were expecting more of the same with this barbie but because she isnt like the past ones she doesnt have as much playabilitythe music note she doesnt sing  only plays rock music and lights are the reason to buy the barbie over the nonmusic version  but the compromise on playability just to have lights is just not worth it  mattel could very easily have had the dress light up the way that the kissing pricess and frog dolls dress does|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|there are two versions of this doll  the one on this page and the fancier one with lights and sound from the dvd movie  note that the one with lights and sound has a huge mechanism between the legs which renders the doll unable to sit down and also a big clunky and thick at the thighs  this doll however has the full range of movements of a typical barbie doll  nor will she break or run out of batteriesi think this is an ideal choice for younger children  the older ones  will likely be upsetdisappointed if they didnt get the barbie with the lights and sound however  especially if their school friends have onethis doll is also a good choice if you get the mariealiece doll  that doll barbies friend in the movie is also very vanilla and lacks soundlightsthis doll is decent quality and playable  worth the amount at which she is offered|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we have both of these  the doll comes with two flowers that keep her upright when in water and a windy hair piece to play with her hairto use the doll you wind up the tail fin and then let it go  the motor a rubber band turns the fins  the problem is that the elasticity of the drive means that when you let the fin go after winding it it goes very fast and then stops  i think this would have been much better if the fin always turned at about the same even speed  as it is you spin the tail forever for about half a second of frantic jerky motion of the fins in the water  whether standing upright wont work in a bathrub or swimming under the water neither works smoothly or easily  its just a quick jerk couple of spins and thats it  the motor just spins too fast and the water pressure isnt enough to slow it downthe doll is quite large and doesnt fit into a bathtub well  i think she is far better suited to a poll where she has room to move around  even then she doesnt really swim and my  year old quickly lost interest in winding up the tail only to have it spin wildly for half a second and then peter out  the doll just jerked more than swamthe tail fins are made of thin vinyl type of material and if left into a bent position too long keeps that position permanently  then she no longer swims at allin all weve already lost the two flower pieces the tails are all bent from bathtub play and my  year old long ago stopped trying to wind her up  which makes a big waste of money in having that motor in thre in the first place  she definitely does not live up to the hype of the commercial|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the misty island thomas movie added quite a few fun toys to the thomas world like the zip and zoom logging adventure a trackmaster setthis set is almost  on amazon and even more at toys r us  i have always thought of the mega bloks sets as something for older children and resisted buying one even though they looked like fun we have wooden trackmasterand take and play thomas sets  your thomas options arewooden set expensive high quality attractive durable and nonmotorizedtrackmaster less expensive motorized plastictake and play smaller doesnt fit on wooden track die cast and plastic a little less expensive than wooden the sets are portable but not extensive good for younger childrenmega bloks can add up to get more than just small pieces of a whole needs construction has flexibility for older children to make and remake setups very small sections are in each set most have a short length of trackwe liked this set because our son likes misty island and because it had both thomas and james and a car  we opened the box and poured out the contents and our  year old excitedly started putting pieces together while we built the basic setup in the instructions  he ended up taking the trains themselves away to play with and seemed to like crashing them off a cliff like diesel in misty island then putting them back togetherit took us  minutes to put together  you really have to pay attention to the little bubbles in the diagrams that show which pieces to connect  once we had it all together we called our son over to play with it  he prefers to manually play with an engine and two cars always two but in this case he put thomas james james tender and the car all together  this track twists and turns there are only two straight sections and they are short one is inside the mountain and its very difficult to get all four of them onto the track correctly while holding it in place so it doesnt slide down  theres no platform where you can really set the trains up then move them like there is on the take and play quarry  so he has to put the trains on the track while slanted and they dont move through the track well manually as he likes  it works better like hot wheels where you start the train at the top and just let it gothis just doesnt fit with what my son likes  the pieces dont stay together well so he just ends up with pieces everywhere that hes too young to put back together  its frustrating for both of us  i just imagine this would be great fun for a  year old who loves putting blocks together and taking them apart and rearranging tracks  maybe in a few years ill find outthough i imagine hell be over thomas by then and hell probably be using legos and not mega bloks|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|for fans of the clone wars this is a fun set celebrating one of the best episodes of the show it includes robonino two commando droids and a weequay piratei suspect most people will get this set for robonino the most exotic character of the bunch hes small but packed with articulation and accessories i find that he grips his blaster and detonator pretty well although theyd probably fall out if you move him too much i love the paint job hasbro really captured the bright quirky colorsthe weequay pirate looks great except for the legs  theyre way too long i know the tv show animation style is stylized but the legs on this figure go a bit too far otherwise the face sculpt and paint job are greatone thing that i dont like about the set is that it includes two commando droids i know there were two in the episode but given the variety of other characters from which to choose such as cad bane aurra sing or ig two commandos seems unnecessary however the droids themselves are excellent figures they have all the articulation one could want with balljoint sockets and balance very well on second though maybe its good we got two of themthe set also includes a short dvd featuring clips of some of the bounty hunters its nothing special its only  minutes long and skips over a few key bounty hunters including my favorite dengar however for kids its a cute bonus feature|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i think the version of cad bane with the little robot sidekick is the best version of the character out it comes with more accessories and the face is painted a darker more realistic blue the ig version here is much better than the standalone one he even has articulated fingers and can grasp his gun i love the rusty metallic look|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i started collecting clone wars figures with capture of the droid multipack i started late in the game so multipacks make more sense for me since i wanted to get a commando droid this set seemed to be a good way to go  besides i wanted to add a few bounty hunters to my clone wars collectionthis pack includes two commando droids shahan alama and robonino from the clone wars first season episode hostage crisis  these figures are sculpted based on their look in the animated series and fairly well articulated just short of vintage style figuresthe commando droids are the figures i was most interested of obtaining  these figures have balljointed head ballhinged shoulders torso knees and ankles and waist swivel neck back and forward but not swivel writs  these figures have a superb sculpt and paint job overall albeit they seem a bit smaller than i expected these include a blaster eachshanan alama is an exclusive figure to this pack  this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows and knees swivel wrists waist and hips but no articulated ankles  the sculpt and paint on this figure are really good  it could even pass as one of hondos pirates  shanan includes a removable shoulders armor a blaster and a daggerrobonino is another exclusive figure to this pack this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders and ankles and swivel waist and hips  the articulation of this figure is limited because of its size  however the sculpt and paint on this figure is good  it includes a functional back pack which pugs directly to its back and holds four explosives a blaster detonator and a blasterthis multipack includes a battle die four bases four game cards and a dvdoverall this pack offers three really fun figures with great likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i stopped collecting star wars back in  and then picked up again in  shaak ti and the geonosian warriors were amongst the last figures i collected back then and the first i got during my rejuvenated collecting the difference is amazing hasbro utilized fabric very well in shaak tis outfit so it isnt too bulky or constraining the geonosian is loaded with articulation which is no mean feat with such narrow limbs he can actually stand on his own now overall these are two excellent figures for fans of atoc|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i dont think this rodian jedi was actually in the geonosis scene in aotc but i absolutely love him this isnt just a rehash of greedo but rather an all new head sculpt the clothes are an appropriate shade of drab and a bit dirty hasbro really took it to the next level in constructing this figurei bought the pack for the rodian but the battle droid is also a great figure even though hes loaded with articulation he stands very well much better construct than the vintage battle droid|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i believe the last time we had a hoth leia was in the potf line this figure is definitely an update with a lot of articulation and beautifully painted clothes the dirt on her outfit looks very appropriate to somebody speeding a lot of time in an underground base my only problem is that the eye pupils are a bit too brown and too large but that might depend upon the actual figure overall this is a wonderful figure|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|usually a good star wars figure is simply one that tries to capture the essence of a character as portrayed in the movies or books occasionally a figure will go beyond that and actually do a better job with the character than the movies themselves this version of dengar is one such figure dengar in empire strikes back seems spaced out and dull by contrast this figure is how i wish dengar was represented the figure has an eerily realistic face with a determined grimace his suit is exquisitely detailed including a backpack and detachable jock strap hes also very articulated although this is almost completely hidden from view and welldisguised in short it reminded me why i loved dengar so much when i first saw him on screen i hope the figure becomes the model for any future portrayals of dengar in the expanded universe or in drawings easily one of the best star wars figures ever|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love these new chewbacca sculpts hasbro has managed to give chewie far more articulation whilst at the same time making him look extremely realistic this figure is nominally based off the hoth scene when he shoots the probe droid fortunately theres not too much snow on him so you can use this figure for a variety of scenes unless chewie gets a vintage edition figure this will probably be the best version of him out there|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure was clearly meant to go with the atat on its own it adheres to the high standards of the vintage line but not too much to write home about my biggest disappointment with the figure is that the goggles and helmet dont both fit at the same time still thats a fairly small complaint in the grand scheme of things long story short definitely get this if you have the atat|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i a recent trip to a brickandmortar i found this chewbacca  i had the one from the clone wars collection but i couldnt resist bringing this one home  suffice to say that i didnt regret my decisionaccording to the packaging this is chewbacca from the film the empire strike back specifically from scenes on hoth  the overall sculpt on the figure is quite good and it does look like chewbacca from the movies but i couldnt tell it was specifically from those scenesout of the box it wears his bandolierbag over its shoulder  however it seems to be attached to the shoulder which prevent it from sliding off as you pose it  it includes a bowcaster in two pieces you need to put the bow across  it also includes a bag of additional weaponsthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows torso knees and ankles and swivel waist wrists and hipsas such it offers a lot of options for posing and greater stability standing  beside the figure and accessories the package also includes a base a battle die and game card  the game card shows chewbacca wearing a respirator not included which i thought it was a scene that happened after they left hothbesides the confusing packaging this is a great figure offering great likeness and posability  im very satisfied with it|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|as far as clone trooper figures go this is definitely the best out there it has all the amazing articulation points fans expect from the vintage line the armor looks nice and shiny theres so much thats good about this figure yet i feel compelled to give it a  rating because a few minor tweaks would have made it the perfect clone trooper first the shoulder pads the joints for the figures shoulder articulation are clearly visible and distracting i cant imagine why hasbro did this especially as it did such a good job with commander cody at hiding those shoulder joints second the helmet looks like its made of cheaper or at least not as shiny material i might be overly critical but i just feel neither of these shortcomings would have been particularly difficult to address still if you get any clone trooper make sure its this one|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily the best version of darth sidious out there although there are probably better emperor palpatine figures the detail on the face is amazing this looks more realistic than the awful makeup in episode iii the sunken eyes and yelling mouth look particularly evil its easy to see the resemblance between this version of darth sidious and palpatine as we see him in episode vi moreover the soft goods are very well done and cover the entire figure i think the robes probably should have been a bit looser because as it is sidious looks a bit too thin also the blue sith lightning doesnt stay on his hand easily i gave it to darth bane instead overall this is a great figure for fans of episode iii or any of the sith figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this was one of those star wars figures i initially didnt pay much attention to after all we have so many versions of anakin right well no this figure is absolutely amazing the level of detail and care that went into making this figure really make it special there are a few things that really make this figure even better than most vintage figures first the hair it looks so real anakin even has a few bangs and strands of hair covering his forehead he looks disheveled exactly as he did in the mustafaar scene second the cloak fits the figure really well unlike many fabric cloaks the hood doesnt stick up and the rest of the cloak falls nicely around him this should be the gold standard in how to make jedi figures from now on definitely a musthave|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is my first clone trooper figure and id have to say overall im impressed of all the clone troopers hes the most memorable i love his chilling betrayal of obiwan in rots in this version of the figure codys color scheme looks great and hes realistic enough that when you put the palpatine hologram in his hands it actually looks like hes listening to it unlike previous versions of cody this figures head is correctly proportioned and looks a bit more battlescarredi only have a few minor complaints first the left foot is at a slight angle this doesnt affect codys ability to stand but is still something that should have been corrected second the lightsaber doesnt fit into the hole in codys belt i just gave it to general grievous to put in his collection finally i would have liked to have seen a bit more weathering on codys armor as it stands he looks a bit too shiny for such a battlehardened vet|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i admit the magna guards didnt strike me as particularly impressive or interesting in rots however their figures are great this vintage edition figure comes with a cloth cape that the droid can wear behind him or over his shoulders the articulation is amazing  some of the best on any figure not only do we get all the usual joints but also the hips are ball joints you can pose the magna guard however you want and he will stand oddly the only joint thats not articulated is his left wrist this is easily a must for fans of rots or highquality figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the core figures in this set are very good owen lars looks great with the bulky robe and realistic stubble hes absolutely great unfortunately maul is ruined by sloppy paint applications the tattoos on his chest look faint my figure even has some dots of red paint applied as if to retouch the figure what a shame  the sculpt of maul is so great if you can get this for a decent price go for it but id warn against paying top dollar for it|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|i grabbed this on a whim at a local store and wouldnt you just know it it was the most popular gift of the day  for those very curious boys out that who bore easily this will keep them entertained for quite some time  and once the experiments are done they have an eye grease pencil and a baseball to play with  the entire science of the curveball is determined and that seems to be the big thing with the boys  theyll stand there and throw that thing as many times as they can to disprove a theory  the best part of these kits is that theyre getting the kids to think about science true but theyre encouraging them to explore things on their own  i think mythbusters in general creates an interest in kids that will cause them to create their own inventions  and instead of just having their heads in their cell phones all day well enjoy all of their new inventionsgreat great product highly loved in this house  recommend|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these two figures are from the infamous deleted scene instar wars episode iv  a new hope    versions disc widescreen edition in the scene fixer and camie tease luke about dreaming about space battles as such this is a pretty neat pair of figures for collectors fixer is well done although he has trouble holding his blaster in his left hand camie is ok not as exciting and her neck looks a bit too thin part of the problem is that the ball allowing her to rotate her head isnt well hidden if you make her look down and look at her from above the figure looks pretty good again these are not figures youll ever play with and maybe not even use for dioramas  although theyd be great for a tatooine homestead diorama  but probably will rest in the display case|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|i think this themed pack probably stems from tv season   episode  james to the rescue james  toby  designated rescue engines for the day  are trying to help gordon who has derailed  against tobys repeated protests that they get rocky to help rather than attempt the rescue themselves james decides to first try coupling gordon and pulling him which only derails him further and then pushing him from the back which ends up cracking the bridge beneath gordon  he then reverses and charges toward gordon intending to shove him back up but as they collide james is sent flying into the muddy marsh  he finally agrees they need rocky  we love it when the trains that come in these themed packs have something to differentiate them from the trains you purchase separately in this case james  his tender as well as both of his rail cars are splattered with mud  as it shows in the picture the first metal blue car with black detailing  red base carries removable bricks  a crate marked sodor building supply while the nd plastic tan car with green base is labeled sodor shipping co on both sides  for some reason the cargo of our grandsons nd car doesnt look like the one in the picture  the one we bought has a big mound of what looks like removable muddy rocks which actually sounds more appropriate than whats in the picture given the name of the  pack  this started out as a big box store target exclusive but fisherprice added it to their own  collector checklist and its now widely available  we paid  for our grandsons  update  fisherprices summer  msrps for their  packs are    except for thomas hard at work which is update  weve really enjoyed collecting all of the  packs especially those with extra designing on the trains  if youre interested in starting your own collection there are  of them as of summer  and they are in order of introduction  gordons snowy special spencers heavy haul edward  the jobi tree thomas  the bees percy hard at work emily stuck in the brush james muddy mess hank  the fishing cars saltys catch of the day james ice cream express percy  kevin to the rescue surprise surprise at the steamworks tree trouble at the dieselworks rockys search  rescue thomas hard at work talking thomas  percy hard at work thomas at the fair muddy ferdinand and tales from the past engine packa little of our own thomas history as first time grandparents my husband and i wanted to start some type of collection for our grandson that he could possibly pass along to his own kids one day  our grandson was   at the time and had been talking a lot about a certain train named thomas a little fella whom  now hard to believe  wed never heard of  after doing some research it seemed the takenplay line might be the perfect investment to engage and encourage his active imagination as well as provide a fun way for us to interact with him  what a rewarding decision weve had so much fun together with this quality line of trains vehicles and playsets  as he approaches  a large portion of our basement has become a wonderful sodor land of make believe that we all enjoy visiting  and continues to hold his interest which is quite a feat given the tendency at that age to move in and out of toy phases so quickly|spam
AJGU56YG8G1DQ|this is a fantastic water gun  ive always loved super soakers and this one is no exception  pump action does require a bit more work but i think it adds to the fun  the hydro cannon soaks people extremely well  the site helps you spot your target properly|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this figure is from the vintage collection general grievous as seen in the film the revenge of the sith  this figure is very well sculped and painted specially on the face and torsoout of the box this figure wears a fabric cape which is removable this cape has pockets on the inside at each side that fit unlit lightsabers  this figure includes two unlit lightsabers and two lighted ones one green and one bluethis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows waist and ankles swivel wrists hips above and below kneethis figure is made out of a rubberyplastic which makes it weak on the legs and difficult to pose at times  the grip on the lightsaber is very loose for separate hands it works better when boths hands hold a lightsaber  fortunatelly the arms can be posed togetherdespite its flaws this is without a doubt the best figure of general grievous available offering great likeness and good posability|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the really nice thing about the lego keychains is that they actually stay on the ring and dont fall off easily  ive had some on my key chain for over a year now with no problemthe clone pilot comes with a brightly painted helmet that has a separate head glued inside more detail  the head is fully posable  the painted detail on the front and back of the chest is quite exception and intricate  very impressive attention to the details with this key chain  because the arms and legs are movable you can have fun posing him the legs move independently which is nice  even the wrists move so you can move around the handsits a great little keychain and a fun toy to boot|spam

AJGU56YG8G1DQ|for anyone who doesnt know about bendaroos theyre essentially pieces of yarn covered in a wax like material  you can stick them to each other cover items in them for a splash of color or use them to write out fun messages  the best part about them is they arent messy  theyre easy to clean up and can be reused again and again  this set is great if kids want to keep their designs around for a while  you can leave the design out for decoration and kids will enjoy it at bedtime too since it glows|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the twlight jane doll is quite lovely and as with all barbie collector dolls comes with stand and certificate of authenticitysome things to note  she is not posable  the legs and arms are hard hollow cheap plastic and do not bend or move in any way  janes going to be posed the same way always  her body is also hollow hard plastic plastic that feels very cheap like a dimestory barbie knock off  its surprising the lack of quality in a barbie collector dolljane is probably best displayed on a shelf or left in her box i wouldnt recommend her for younger kids who want to play with her  likely theyd break a hollow leg easily she clearly is not of the same quality as the previous twilight barbie dolls which is a shame|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i bought ellie mae at the same time as the i dream of jeannie doll  i ended up liking the jeannie doll much moreellie maes hair is not stylable or brushable  it is practically glued into place into stiff and unmoveable gobs  even the twirls at the back are hard and unmoveable  shes clearly meant to be a statue and not a dollanother detail im not as happy about is the shirt  the faux buttons on top hide two snaps underneat  and those snaps are placed one above the bust and one at the pants line  that leaves a gaping hole under the  fake buttons  the snaps also bulge out from under the shirt  making an unattractive ddisplaythe rest of the details of the outfit are fine and she comes with a slingshot  in all if choosing to buy only one or two of the retro s tv character dolls this might be the last one you would chose  jeannie and bewitched look better|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this ken collector fashion doll has a wonderful interpretation of classical japanese fashion  note that the windows peak on his forehead is painted on but it does make the doll more interesting  he comes with a sword for display purposes and his hair is long and unbound in the back  in all it is quite a striking doll and makes an excellent display  im very pleased with this purchase|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|as others have noted this ken doll is quite fun  you can play back whatever you record in several types of voices  it really makes my  year old laugh to hear her voice deep like a mansthe only detraction for me is that he has solid legs so he isnt that posable other than bending at the waist  his clothes are nearly identical to the shaving fun ken doll and his hair is nearly solid from the gel  you cant style itbut in all a fun doll with a lot of play value|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|what a mess  on the second day my  year old was playing with this doll it snapped in half  what we didnt realize is that the bust is attached to the waist with a small plastic rod to make the transformation happen  she doesnt have any poseability and my daughter didnt realize that she bent the doll over to sit her and snap  there was a sharp broken plastic piece exposed on both ends the doll has hollow hard plastic cheap legs so the only way to make her sit was to bend her at the waist just like the other barbies  except you find out the hard way that she cant bend sit or even posemore disturbing was the sharp plastic pieces on each end of the broken area  that cant be safe  we made sure to look for any pieces that might have flown off when it snapped as well in case her  year old cousin visitedeven before it broke however we could tell it suffers from the same problem that mariposa and a lot of the other transforming fairy dolls had the wings do not stay on nor will they stay up  i wish we had bought the less expensive non transforming version insteadeverything about the doll feels cheap the legs are cheap hollow plastic not softer vinyl the dress works oddly if at all she doesnt have undergarments so when she bends over she bares all the face and hair are very generic looking barbie actually reminiscent of the cheaper  line of dolls and her chestbody is very square and oddly shaped  that doesnt even take into account that the wings just fall off all the time even our winx dolls have wings that dont fall off  whats the point of a fairy doll if the wings dont stay on everfinally the whole transforming thing is a joke  you pull strings in the back that hang down below the length of the doll when not in use to pull up the dress so it goes from ankle length to fairy length short  but the strings only pull up one inner skirt and not the outer oneneither my daughter nor i can push the small sharp edged butterfly button on the wings to make those raise up and when they do only one goes up limply and the other goes half way and falters  even if the wings stayed on we couldnt get them to workin all an incredibly bad dolls in every regard  get the nontransforming version of this doll and save yourself the disappointment|ham

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter is an ardent fan of strawberry shortcake and she has many of the dolls in various sizes this lemon meringue doll is beautiful with a cute outfit the striped leggings are adorable and comes with several accessories the accessories are small and can easily be mislaid but it doesnt really bother my daughter as she is always more interested in the doll itself lemon meringue has the most lustrous golden hair and my daughter enjoys combing it out the doll has moveable arms and legs so this makes for easy play and posing is not a problemthat being said part of the charm in the strawberry shortcake series of dolls is the wonderful signature scent unique to each doll i found that these series of dolls we also own blueberry muffin do not have as strong a scent as the smaller dolls figurines the strongest scent is on the hair and face of the doll and one has to take a really strong whiff to get the scent it would have been nice if the dolls had been more generously scented as this is part of the attraction in the strawberry shortcake dolls other than that this is a charming toy and will be a great addition to an ss fans collection|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my sixyearold daughter loves mlp and friends and we have begun collecting the toys and playsets this is a cute playset featuring applejack who loves helping out on the farm the little barn itself is nothing to get too excited about because it is basically just a piece of plastic and the barn itself doesnt really have a back just a front with two little doors that swing openthe playset does come with two adorable little friends a rooster and a cat it was too bad that they didnt include the bunny which is applejacks special little friend we got that by purchasing the individual pony set that comes with applejack and bunny anyway the set comes with many tiny little pieces ie an apple two carrots a watering can a shovel a lasso a bale of hay a bucket and a nice little wagon that can be hitched to applejack i would say this is worth buying to complete a mlp playset collection and it is a lot of fun|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|although technic lego items are usually quite a bit more difficult than legos regular sets this one doesnt follow its roommates in technic land  its actually quite simple to assemble and has quite a few neat attributes ie steering wheel that actually moves large heavyduty trucklike wheels that turn etc this guy took my experienced builder about  minutes to assemble so keep that in mind if buying for a new lego fan  these technic sets are great for understanding the engineering of engines and overall mechanics and this set does that nicely with the definitive drivetrain  just a really neat set its appreciated greatly in this house highly recommend|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|so my daughter kindergartner was allowed after much pleading to open one of the wrapped presents under our christmas tree tonight she picked this without knowing what was in it this disney light up rapunzel doll was on her wish list and she was very happy to receive itthe packaging for the doll was incredibly tiresome is it just me or has packaging for toys become ridiculously complicated as the years pass by  shouldnt it be the other way around so after that was all done we got the doll out and my daughter immediately went to work with the hairbrush it comes with the doll together with a hand mirror and also a removable tiara and a pair of shoes the doll itself is beautiful to look at and has the big lovely green eyes of the heroine of tangled she looks like a toddler version of the grownup rapunzel and is quite adorable which is why my daughter requested this in the first placeher hair is a beautiful blonde and lustrous when one runs the brush through the hair from the top it activates the light up feature and the scalp glows making it appear as though the hair is lit up like in the movie our doll came with batteries included and all my daughter had to do was brush the hair here is where i can see problems  the hair is very long and gets tangled pardon the pun easily my daughter got a bit impatient and tugged the brush through the hair causing some of it to come off at this point i offered to comb out the tangles and it took me awhile i can imagine younger children getting impatient and pulling on the hair causing the hair to come out in clumps i solved the problem temporarily by offering to braid the hair and my daughter used some of her own hair accessories to decorate rapunzels hair she was still able to brush the top of the hair and see it light up so no problems there my advice  this doll is cute but i would not recommend it for children under five the child has to have some level of patience to brush the hair and keep the doll from going bald|ham

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter is a great fan of strawberry shortcake and weve been collecting the various playsets i was initially worried about purchasing this playset after reading a negative review but my daughter loved the idea of a swing set and since i managed to get this at a discount i went ahead and purchased itwe had no issues with stability the green leaf base is a good anchor for the strawberry swing set and my daughter was able to play with this set on both hardwood floors as well as on the carpet and even outside on the grass my sixyearold daughter managed to get the dolls in and out of the swings with no difficulty and since she had the other ss dolls she had fun switching them out for rides i do feel though that a younger child under five might have difficulty getting the dolls in and out of the swings theres a cute little berrykin that can be attached to the top of the yellow flower and she wished there had been several more as she loves the critters there are two butterkins butterflylike figures and they are adorable but here is where we ran into problems the wings are extremely fragile and despite careful handling both butterkins lost a wing each for this reason i took two stars off as quality is important to me when it comes to childrens toys other than that this is a cute addition to the ss range of toys though i wish the manufacturers would pay more attention to the quality of the sets and not produce flimsy toys|ham
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my kindergartner chose this as an incentive for doing well on her piano test i was initially taken by the front of the set which is very attractive and since it was discounted at a retail store i went ahead and purchased it it was nice to note that the manufacturers have replaced those annoying hard plastic ties with ones that are much easier to cut away when removing the toys from the packagingas i said the front of the clubhouse is very attractive the first problem we came across was trying to get the clubhouse to remain upright without falling over it is frontheavy and tends to fall over the back is just a small space with barely any room for several strawberry shortcake and friends dolls the size as pictured on product page i wish the manufacturers had made it larger in the back so that the dolls and several accessories could fit comfortably in the back after all it is a clubhouse the neat thing about this set is the little basket that can be pulled up and down using a pulley theres a strawberry shortcake doll that comes with this set and her pet pupcake theres also a cute little telescope not real that can be placed at the top as well as a mailbox that can be opened and closed with two cardboard letters which can be placed within my daughter has figured out a way to make her playtime with this set an enjoyable one  she uses the treehouse for her zoobles as an extension set the set on its own does not yield quality playtime because theres not much that can be placed in it and it is difficult to remain upright|ham
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|its that time of year again when moms like me are searching for perfect little stocking stuffers for their little ones my first grader and some of her friends are great fans of the littlest pet shop range of toys and among their favorites are the blythe dolls for some reason the dolls are all called blythe but it doesnt matter we go ahead and rename them anywaythis cutie comes with some really nifty accessories such as a comb to brush that gorgeous reddish hair a pretty little headband with a pink flower on it made my daughter crave a lifesize one a water bottle no the top does not come off a little picture depicting blythe doll and pet on a tire swing and a picnic basket which like another reviewer mentions opens very stiffly though it does snap back in place  my daughter likes to put tiny food erasers in it from iwakothe headband is removable which is great as my daughter likes to swap accessories on her dolls and the shoes are easy to take off yet dont fall off easily unlike some other brand dolls so i dont imagine those shoes getting lost anytime soon phew the clothes can be removed with some effortnow the downside to these dolls is that they are not able to stand on their own but the dolls do each come with a little stand that helps owners prop them up our favorite feature is the large manga eyes like those featured in japanese animation this doll which we have renamed yvette has beautiful green eyes with gluedon eyelashes that feel really soft and this little detail makes a great difference to the dolls aesthetic value recommended for children ages  and up and collectors of course|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its surprisingly difficult to find a good figure of a skeleton warrior using the jason and the argonauts skeleton warriors revoltech made a beautiful figure that is both incredibly detailed and fully articulated the skeletons bones look like well bones each figure gets a nice black wash so he looks dirty supposedly each figures wash is slightly different so each figure is uniquewhen i say this figure is fully articulated i do mean fully hes got doubleball joints for all major joints including two for his back you have to work with him a bit but eventually you can get him into almost any pose you could imagine some of the joints might be too loose some too tight if theres a critical joint that doesnt work well you could always replace it with one from the spare arm or the skeleton coming out of the ground just carefully pull the body part out of the joint then take the ball joint out and replace it but be carefulthe figure also comes with quite a few different accessories including  different hands an arm dedicated to holding the shield two swords a spear two shields and a base with a skeleton coming out of the ground the back side of the base includes peg holes so you can store all of the unused accessories there its a brilliant solution to keeping everything safe and sorted i can stand how i have so many accessories for my figma figures just lying aroundoverall if youre looking for a skeleton warrior or even just a skeleton this will probably do the trick i got him to use as a stalfos with my  figma link figure its almost exactly in scale highly recommended|spam
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|our friends got this set for our kindergartner for christmas and she is very happy with the set i think there might be an error with the product description as it does not seem to describe what is portrayed in the picture and product title there are six fairy dolls in this boxed set  fawn rosetta iridessa tinker bell vidia and silver mist the dolls are beautiful and look much like their counterparts in the tinker bell movie the great fairy rescue these dolls can be easily played with and manipulated though there are no attached stands unlike what is mentioned in the product descriptionthe only complaint i have about these dolls is the wings which are attached by velcro to the dolls they are quite flimsy and can easily fall off my daughter got sick of picking them up and finally just set them aside the other thing is that i would advice leaving the elastic bands on the fairies feet as these bands actually prevent the shoes from falling off she did have a lot of fun playing with them though the dolls are large enough to make playtime fun and they are just the right size for my daughters dollhouse these are beautiful fairy dolls that are sure to delight young children ages  and up|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a lovely doll  she features a thin sheaf dress in a klimt inspired pattern  the dress has long medieval type of sheer fabric drapes  and there is an additional drape in the back with an inner lining matching the sleeves falls like a bubble dressthe doll is wearing nothing underneath  they didnt even bother to paint underwear  and flesh colored pumps which dont seem to go with the lookfeel of the dress the dress material is very thinone plus is that her hair is very soft and fully curly all the way around  it is quite lovelyin all a lovely doll but much better left in the box as a display than removed|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the  holiday barbie has all the hallmarks of the series a lovely barbie in special collector packaging and fantastic gownthis years barbie comes in a rare slim gold underskirt rather than the usual large hemmed ball gown with flowing green silklike overskirt  the overskirt is decorated with gold embroidery and jewel details  her hazel eyes with their sparkly gold eyeshadow make a nice match with the golden chandelier earrings she wears matching gold open toed shoes under the skirt  this is definitely one of the most sophisticated looking of all the holiday barbiesas with all of the recent collector holiday barbies she really isnt intended to be deboxed or played with the doll doesnt come with a stand and her hair is heavily gelled to keep the curls in place not really suitable for brushing or you destroy the style  as well the back of the dress lacks the details of the front and doesnt have any of the volume when removed recebt year holiday barbies like this one have cardboard inserts under the dresses to keep them fluffed out and full in the hemline  her dress is sewn into the box to keep a perfect display  it isnt quite as lovely when removed and without the restraints to keep it in place  she also has the model muse body  which means she isnt pivotal and cant hold any other pose  there were two very slight barely visible pulls in the gold part of the dress on my doll  her hair is a mess in the backsince the box is heavily decorated with the arriving at the christmas ball theme to match the dress id recommend this for those who enjoy the entire display without wanting to debox  if you are giving this as a present for a younger child to display out of the box youll need to get a barbiesized doll stand separatelyin all a lovely addition to the series though i do wish they would include display stands for those of us who like to remove our barbies from the box|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|i enjoyed the original game of life and when i saw this new edition which is a variation on the original i decided to give it a try my eightyearold daughter and i spent a fun afternoon playing it the other day initially i was a bit frustrated as the setup was tricky and tedious however once everything was set up it was easy to play and we enjoyed it a lot players can now get pets and children little plastic bits so buyers may want to take note of this if you have children underfive at home since the pieces can pose a choking hazardthere are other elements that make this game of life adventures a fun board game players can get passports and visit unique locations players also have the option of picking out the length of the game to be played eg retiring at age  for example the objective the person with the most money wins it is also highly educational for a young child  i got my daughter to act as banker and she enjoyed her role while learning how to dole out money and collect money all in all this is a neat variation on the original|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my daughter loves her disney dolls but has shown a real interest in more realistic dolls when she goes to friends houses  therefore i really wanted to get her a realistic doll  the appeal of adora is that they make a very strong line of dolls which means you can go through all of them with your child and pick out the one that is perfect for herwhen the doll arrived my daughter was so excited  we got her out of the packaging and she sat her down to have tea with her  she kept playing with the hair a lot and was a little sad that she had a fixed hairband so that she couldnt do as much with her silky blonde hair as she would have likedi was surprised at the high quality of the doll and the realism  shes quite weighty and has real diapers  of course she has a face and hair that is more like a toddler along with legs that are more like a newborn bent inwards and wears a diaper so that part is less realistic but cutemy only disappointment was that it takes some effort to get her to sit up my daughter is always sitting her here or there to eat breakfast watch a movie etc  it takes her a little bit of effort but not badthe expression is cute and innocent  i did have a comment from another family member that she was a little creepy but that of course is a perspective based on how many horror movies you have seen|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is probably not only the best figure of lando as a general but also the best figure of lando the head sculpt really captures billy dees likeness as well as his fro the cape beautifully drapes over his shoulders the strap in the front is a bit thick but it doesnt bother me too much it keeps the cape in place as opposed to those little strings that sometimes move around too much while there probably isnt a huge demand for lando in his generals uniform id definitely recommend it for fans of the mon calamari briefing room in jedi|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the vintage line just keeps getting better this guy was a background character if there ever was one yet hasbro put as much care and love into him as if they were making a star character maybe more the face has an incredible amount of detail even compared to other alien figures in the vintage line you can actually feel the scales on his head and touching them feels like touching a snake however what really makes fi ek sirch stand out is his incredible cloak its got a very rough feel to it and has a slightly tattered look best of all drapes perfectly over the figure this guy is easily the best of the attack of the clones wave of the vintage line  and that was one of the better waves thus far|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this lando is from his adventure just before the battle above endor and a geat companion to luke han solo and leia from their adventure in endor  and i must admit im thrilled with this version of landothis figure is from the vintage collection lando as seen towards the end of the film return of the jedi  the face has an incredible resemblance to billy dee just the mustache should have been split and the body is very detailed as wellout of the box it wears a fabric cape a belt with a holster across his chest and a normal belt at his waist line  all of these are removable and the holster can actually hold the blaster  the figure can hold the gun ok for now given that it came holding it with a transparent elastic band doesnt give me to much hope for the futurethis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows hips knees and ankles and swivel waist and wristsone thing i have an issue with is the off colored hinges behind the ankles  my sharpie was begging to fix that issue for leia and now for this one as welloverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|hasbro did right by the tartakovsky clone wars with this figure this is the red arc trooper commando from the cartoon short in volume  its an incredibly detailed figure hasbro got the paint and detailing down perfectly hasbro also loaded him with articulation and accessories the hip joints allow you to put him in any action pose with the two helmets and two bandoliers you can create many different versions of the arc trooper in short hasbro set a new standard for clonetrooper figures the only problem is that hasbro didnt make enough of them and theyve become quite expensive so its tough to army build definitely recommended for fans of the tartakovsky clone wars|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ive had several yoda toys over the years but this one is hands down the best i absolutely love him close to perfectionfirst i should say first of all that yoda looks a lot better in person than on the box the yoda on the box is a yellowgreen whereas in person yoda is correctly colored in fact the paint job really captures the look of the puppet in empire strikes back  the one area where the paint job gets a bit sloppy is on the edges of the fingernails and toenails fortunately you can actually gently scrape away some of the excess white paint with your fingernail and itll look perfectyoda comes loaded with articulation and accessories he comes with  extra pairs of hands an extra pair of feet with curling toes his cane belt necklace pouch a bundle of sticks as a diorama piece and essentially a bench and a bendable snake the sideshow exclusive edition comes with an orange snake as well but i couldnt find that one the extra hands are nice as they really allow you to capture the character at different moments you can have him gripping a cane or pointing towards the stars in short you can pose him just about any way you wantunfortunately sideshow is not producing his figure anymore this figure can be expensive on the secondhand market however if you love yoda from the original trilogy no less this guy is worth every penny in fact holding him in my hands now my only regret is that i didnt search a bit harder to try to get the exclusive edition with the orange snakethis is the first star wars figure ive gotten from sideshow and im very impressed its convinced me to buy thesideshow yodas dagobah hutto give yoda a suitable home|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of the smaller pigsabout the size of a baseball but it has quality plush and appliques  it looks suitably confused just like the king pig from the game of note the nose on the pig does make him pitch forward when sitting  and the crown is soft so you dont have to worry about ruining it if the pig gets chucked or chucked at  it has nice details in the ears and nose and i like that the design is all sewn appliques rather than hard buttons or stickersto get the sound you press the forehead between the eyes and the crest and it plays only one sound from the game unlike the birds which play  soundsall of the birdspigs from the game have a larger base so they sit still without rolling over despite being ball shaped  the noise maker is suitably padded and you can throw this around quite a bit without worrying it will break the sound boxwe have all of the sizes of the birds and pigs and this size is nice and compact  a bit firmer than the larger onesin all its expensive for the size but it is a quality piece|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|this is a very nicelooking rapunzel doll but limited in play potential the wand that comes with the doll makes rapunzel sing a verse from her popular song and her gown lights up and looks very becoming especially in the dark the good thing is that pressing the star on the gown also makes rapunzel sing so there is an alternative in case the wand gets misplacedother than that this is more for a collector or for display older children ages six and up will enjoy combing out rapunzels lovely hair and seeing her gown glow but other than that this doll has limited play potential the gown cannot be removed because of the effects it does and the legs dont bend either so that limits a childs ability to play for any length of time with the dolli got this through the vine program because i thought my first grader would love playing with it since she loves her baby rapunzel lightup doll but the limited play possibilities of this doll as nice as it is has made me decide to keep it for display instead|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i have mixed feelings about this figure one the one hand its a beautifully sculpted and painted figure he comes with two axes and a staff his helmet also comes off showing his bald head one blog named this the figure of the year and in terms of quality its hard to disagree on the other hand the skirt is puffy making the gamorrean a bit of a fuzzball the previous version of the figure star wars otc gamorrean guard with the plastic skirt actually looks a bit more like the guards in star wars episode vi  return of the jedi    versions disc widescreen edition this certainly isnt enough to take a star off in fact this version of the gamorrean is even better looking than the one in the movie id just recommend combing the skirt down or even using water so it stays down another option is to twist the skirt around because the back part of the skirt is shorter than the front doing this actually works really well|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|with the rerelease of fan favorites i got the chance to finally adquire a gamorrean guard and han solo bespin outfit  finally i find out by myself that the gamorrean guard is as great as others say it would bethe gamorrean guard is sculpted based on the character as shown in the movie the return of the jedi  this figure has an excellent head sculpt  also a lot of good details were added to this figure specially on its armor and even including some furlike fabricout of the box the gamorrean guard comes out wearing a helmet and an overtheshoulder harness both of them removable  it also includes a lance a short axe and a long axethis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hipsindeed this is an awesome figure that offers great likeness and good posability|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this figure is mace windu from attack of the clones movie the sculpt of the face has the best resemblance to mace windu character the rest of the body is well sculpted as well the clothes in particular are well detailed which include fabric from the waist downthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows waist knees and ankles and swivel hips and wriststhis figure includes a removable robe a lightsaber and a lightsaber hiltoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily the best version of kit fisto the articulation is all one could ask for and the paint job is superb this is definitely the definitive version of kit fisto the only complaint i had is with the hood because of kit fistos head tails the hood doesnt really fit well over his head even more frustrating if you want to display the figure wearing the robes but with his hood down the hood doesnt really fit under the head tails so theyre covered its a tough problem and im not sure how hasbro could have solved it but it is a problem nonetheless otherwise highly recommended|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this figure is kit fisto from the attack of the clones film  it has a great sculpt of both head and body  the jedi tunic is well detailed and includes fabric from the waist downout of the box it wears a hooded robe that can be removed  however the hood is badly sewed to the robe but this may be my figure  it includes a green lightsaber and an unlit lightsaber that the figure can wear on its beltthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows hips knees and ankles and swivel wrists and waistthis figure should have a better articulation than it does  the tunic at the shoulders limit the movement of the arms straight up  also the elbows and knees feel limited but it may be my figurethis figure can be posed in highly dynamic poses but i expected a bit more given the type of articulation it has  overall this figure offers good likeness and posability|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i had jango fett in my radar ever since i started to collect star wars figure again about a month ago  entering so late into the fray i had but a glimmer of hope to get this figure at a normal price  well hope is still alive because i finally got jango in my collection and a a reasonable pricethis figure is from the vintage collection jango fett as seen in the film attack of the clones once i removed the helmet i noticed that face has a great resemblance to the character in the film  the body is very detailed as well it even include cables coming from his bracers and joining into the bicep area  more about this laterout of the box this figure wears a rubbery plastic helmet a fabric poncho with a backpack on top and a belt with two holsters  all these are removable but the belt  at least i havent figured out how to remove it  it also includes a head set and a missile and two blasters which fit well in the holstersthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows torso knees and ankles and swivel biceps wrists and hipsswivel biceps  yes  since a rubbery plastic cable connects from the bracers to the biceps the ballhinged elbows are limited on mobility  however the biceps swivel just above the cables bypassing this issueoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i have mixed feelings about this figure i think hasbro got a lot right the face the jacket and accessories are all great yet the hair really bothers me its a fairly bold white and really sticks out also most of the body is the from thestar wars original trilogy yoda action figure the elbows only have swivel joints not ball joints this is particularly troubling when you try to pose yoda in a fighting stance with his lightsaber his range of motion is limited id recommend getting this yoda if you want to have a duel scene with darth sidious however if you just want a yoda especially an original trilogy version check out the otc figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i dont know if its just my version or what but this luke skywalker figure has very thin legs and theyre too close together the legs are attached to the hip via ball joint so its still possible to position him but i find he still really only stands well with a stand also his face looks a little too california boy for my tastes its not a bad figure id give it  stars overall but just isnt one id recommend going out of your way to get if you already have  other versions of luke|ham
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|im trying to complete my return of the jedi collection from  years ago the weequays are not in my list but i want to have at least one of them this one will do while i wait for the skiff guardthis figure is from the vintage collection weequay skiff master as seen in the film return of the jedi the face is a good sculpt and a good resemblance to the character the body is very detailed as well specially its clothes the shoulder pads are part of the shoulder joint so the figure still has full range of motion ironically the tunic below his waist is plastic which has a great sculpt but limit the hip joints a bitout of the box it wears a holster on his belt non removable and the blaster fit well in it it also include a staff and a blasterthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows torso knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hipsoverall this figure offers good likeness and posability|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|the arc trooper is from the expanded universe with the included accessories you can recreate its look from the current clone wars series and it shows the clone troopers transition from the attack of the clones to the revenge of the sithout of the box this figure comes with the helmet from the attack of the clones but it also include the helmet from the revenge of the sith i expected to see the standard clone face under the helmet it is a clone but this one has personalitythis figure wears a white and red body armor stylized on attack of the clones era however it includes a shoulder pad and holster to customize its look for the revenge of the sith era it also includes two blastersthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows wrists torso hips knees and anklesas such it is a very posable figure however the ballhinged hips are tricky to use for posing it has a good grip of his blaster pistol and rifle however i think that the helmet is a tad big for this figureoverall this figure offers good likeness and great posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|logray has seen several rereleases over the years truth be told the original potf version wasnt half bad and could still be used as a generic ewok today however this vintage style logray goes way beyond its predecessors first the paint and sculpt look extremely realistic and a bit grittier hes got about as much articulation as is possible for such a small figure with ball and joint hips and shoulders however what really makes this wicket better is the accessories he comes with a removable headgear spear and staff next to the vintage wicket this figure is essential for any fan of return of the jedi|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this figure is from the vintage collection logray as seen in the film return of the jedi given that lumat is essentially the same sculpt as logray im again impressed on how well this figure was sculpted the detail on the fur are amazing however the painting on this figure albeit well done is slightly off the presented picture in the cardout of the box this figure wears a ceremonial skull and a medicine bag it also include a spear and a chanting staffthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows hips and ankles swivel wrists and waist but no articulated kneesoverall this figure offers good likeness and good posability  im not a fan of ewoks but i must say that logray was a good buy for me|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|im a big fan of the star wars eu figures at least kotor heir to the empire and njo and was excited when i heard bastila shan was going to become a figure however when i first saw the photos of her i was a bit worried fortunately i received the figure recently and really am impressed for whatever reason this figure isnt photogenic but she looks beautiful in person just like bastila shan in the game the likeness is pretty spot on and the outfit is perfect shes a thin figure but even so manages to pack  points of articulation even more important all of that articulation is well hidden and blends with her outfit there also seem to be far fewer paint misapplications on bastila shan than most other star wars figures the only bad thing i can say about this figure is that it doesnt come in a pack with canderous ordo or carth onasi im crossing my fingers that hasbro keeps making such good kotor figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the rebel fleet trooper has always been a fan favorite all the more so because it was never released in the original vintage line the first version from the potf wasnt bad but was a bit on the muscular side later versions were better but not perfect this vintagestyle version is near perfect the figure is fairly lanky and looks more like the hapless troops on the tantive iv the accessories are fantastic the trooper has his standard gun hand binoculars a strap of grenades around his ankle his trademark helmet  no less  and a baseball cap all of these accessories are removable if you see more than one of these definitely get a few  theyre ideal for troop building|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the vintage collection really delivers with this version of ponda baba of course as with all the vintage figures the paint and sculpt jobs are beautiful and the figure has as much articulation as one could want what makes ponda baba really special are the accessories  or in this case the removable arms first you can remove the right forearm and leave a bloody stump in its place second and even better the figure comes with two types of hands  flippers and regular hands  as a monument to the infamous blooper in a new hope when the character was seen with walrus hands in most cuts but his severed hand looked more like a a hairy apes hand its a cool feature and one that should be required for any ponda baba figures in the future my only complaint is that the jacket is attached to the body and isnt removable personally id always liked the removable jackets just because they hung on the figures better however with the removable arms i can understand why hasbro might not have wanted to mess around with a removable jacket overall this figure is a great tribute to the most infamous part of the cantina scene|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the echo base trooper certainly isnt the most exciting figure nor even the most exciting in wave  of the vintage collection bastila shan or ponda baba win on that count but he is a good figure for army building as usual the articulation and paint and sculpt are all great oddly enough though this figure still has a weak center of balance i had trouble getting him to stand even on fairly flat surfaces he will stand but i feel like a bit more maneuverability in the ankles might have helped|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|sun and moon tarot is a new deck created by vanessa decort and inspired on the now classic thoth tarot  vanessas surrealistic yet lively artwork simplify the imagery of the classic deck while maintaining some of its mysticism making it more accessible taroti bought this deck just based on the few pictures i was able to find in the internet and suffice to say that im glad that i did  it is not often that you can get your hands in a new reinterpretation of the classic thoth tarotthe back of these cards are bordered white with a black background and a mandalalike white and grey flower in the center making these card reversible  the face of these cards are also bordered white with the imagery occupying most of the cardthe imagery in these cards often incorporates faceless human figures in lively surrealistic scenes  some of the symbols found in the thoth tarot can also be found in these cards such as the hebrew alphabet and planetary associations on the major arcana and elemental symbols on the minor arcana  suffice to say that these images are a departure from the ones found in the thoth tarotthe major arcana are numbered with roman numerals at the top starting on  with the fool and labeled on lower case lettering at the bottom  as in the thoths tradition the world has been renamed the universe but a few retain their names found in the rws tradition such as justice and strength although these are numbered viii and xi respectively  some major arcana are double labeled  this is a list of the cards that depart from thoth taroti the magus  the magicianii the priestess  the high priestessviii adjustment  justicex fortune  wheel of fortunexi lust  strengthxiii death  deathrebirthxiv art  arttemperancexx the aeon  aeonjudgmentnotice that temperance and judgment are the label for major arcana  and  in the riderwhitesmith rws decksome of the symbols that you find in the thoth tarot can be found in the sun and moon tarot but the esoteric imagery in the former is replaced with a more mundane imagery in the later  for example  the fool is shown as a guy with a backpack at the edge of a cliff a tiger behind him and an alligator before him and he is still swirl by a butterfly  the magician has a drum hanging from his neck  he points to the sky where a mystical circle formed by a snake is shows  all twelve zodiac signs surrounds an inner circle bordering a six point star  within the circle a sword crosses a staff which are covered by a pentacle which is covered by a chalice  the symbol of infinity is shown above and the symbol of yinyang belowthere are a few major arcana that radically depart from the imagery found on the thoth tarot favoring  such as  strength shows a girl sitting on top of a wolf  the wolf howls to the huge moon in background  a butterfly floats above the wolf heads  deathrebirth shows a phoenix carrying up a woman as it rises from the flameshowever i found that some of the cards favor the imagery found in the rws tarot instead of the thoth tarot  such as  arttemperance shows a winged figure pouring water from a white chalice to a black one  a yellow sky at his left and a blue sky at his right divided by a whirl starting from a yinyang symbol floating above his head  the aeonjudgment shows a winged figure floating above sounding a trumpet as three people stand in the waterthe minor arcana are composed of the four standard suits of pentacles wands cups and swords corresponding to the elements of earth fire water and air  each suit is illustrated with distinctive scenes  golden skies with pentacles indigo starry skies with often fiery wands deep blue moon lit skies over water with cups and light blue cloudy skies with swordseach one of the pips are labeled in lower case lettering with a key word at the top and number and suit at the bottom  the court cards are labeled mostly according with the thoths tradition princess prince and queen  however the knights are labeled kings instead although all the kings are riding horsesthis deck includes a little white book lwb divided as followsintroduction to tarot and the sephirotthe major arcanathe minor arcanareading the cardsabout the authorthe introduction starts with short explanation about tarot the major arcana and the minor arcana suit association to the elements  it continues with the interpretation of the major arcana as the fools journey  it briefly mentions the association of the major arcana with the  path of the sephirot the tree of life in judaic mysticism and concludes with the association of tarot with numerologythe major arcana and minor arcana sections provide description of each card explaining the symbols found in the imagery and a few key words  in addition the major arcana section includes the astrological association for each card and hebrew character  reading the cards section provides some ideas on how to use the cards but doesnt offer any layoutsthis deck really deserves a full size book treatment but the lwb will suffice for nowif you are open to a refreshingly new take on the thoths tarot or you are a tarot enthusiastic this may be one deck you should consider adding to your collection|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter received this as an th birthday present and i found that this is sold at a local retail store for under twenty dollars so comparison shopping is advised since it is being offered here for twice the price there are many tiny toys that come with this set such as a little cutlery set tiny plastic drinking cups etc so it is not advisable for children under  the set itself is awesome as it has tons of features the caravan comes completely assembled but can be taken apart to play with for example the top can come off and the two surfboards can be taken off the cool thing is the surfboards have wheels on them and the pinypon figure that comes with the set can be placed on it theres a little groove for the pinypon dolls foot to go on and voila the pinypon doll is set to go on the ride of her lifetheres a little beach chair that the doll can sit on two little sleeping bunkers attached to the caravan a builtin refrigerator with doors that can open and you can place the little food items that come with the set into it drawers that open and close and many more theres also a bunch of stickers that come with this set but the best part is that the sticker sheet is numbered so that you know exactly where to place each sticker i think an older child can manage this independently but younger children might need the help of a parent to place all the stickersthe best part of this caravan is the little attached splashing pool that can be opened out and filled with water theres a little attached hose and shower head which when submerged into the pool for a while is able to squirt out water to shower the pinypon doll you have to press the attached pump to get the water going its simple really and great fun my daughter got this as a birthday present and she loves playing with it and taking it on playdates great great fun|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|these napkins are made of thick paper and worked well  the graphic is printed nice and bright and they look great at a monster high themed party  keep in mind that they are small in size  half the size of a regular napkin  but that makes it easier to use them at parties and not have them take up too much room|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the plate sets are brightly patterned with strong graphics  they are thick coated and very sturdy we put everything from hot food to ice cream that melted everywhere and they held up well  they dont bend at all so they are great for carryingthese are dessert plates so they are very small  think the small plate that you put a roll on at a restaurant you can fit ice cream or a cupcake  perhaps a small slice of birthday cake only|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the items in this package are of very good quality  the plates are thick brightly printed and held up under ice cream cake and greasy french friends with no problem  the cups are a bit on the small side causing plenty of extra refills but that can be an asset if one is knocked over and spills  less to go everywhere  in all we were pleased with the items|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|sideshow has done it again where hasbro only gave collectors a cheap paper diorama background of the cantina in the late s sideshow provides a nice large bulky environment for our cantina figures and this cantina environment is large it easily fits the entire modal nodes band  members as well as one of the cantina tables two chairs and two figures seated in the chair the environment also has two lights that light up and a doublesided windowi have absolutely not problems with what isnt included the environment is pretty expensive for basically amounts to two walls and part of a ceiling the set doesnt come with any bar glasses stools or chairs however the thing i found most disappointing is the lack of a floor there is no floor at the bottom of the environment this really undermines the set it would have really completed the scene to have a floor to go along with the two walls and ceilingif you can afford it and love the cantina scene its definitely works wonderfully as a way to display your figures|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|the secret tarot is a gothic looking tarot deck drawn by marco nizzoli and based on the tarot of marseilles and rider tarot  this deck screams renaissance meets gothic  nizzoli comic book style artwork shows glimpses of a world where the bygone era is still alive heavily influenced by a gothic flairnizzoli images are inked with non intrusive outlines and painted with low contrasting colors and subtle shadows  nudity is more persistent through this deck than in any others although is tastefully done at all timesthe cards are labeled in five languages  the italian label written with dark blue ink is prominently shown at the bottom  the english spanish french and german labels written with black ink are shown at the top of the card and at both side of the numeral written in dark blue inkthe tarot of marseilles is evident throughout the major arcana with few nods to the rider and visconti tarots  this is a deck where justice is  and strength is   the marseilles tradition can be easily identified in cards such as the lovers a finely dressed man deciding between two different women the wheel of fortune a dog a winged monkey and nonwinged monkey around a wooden wheel and the sun two naked boys standing under the sun  a nod to the rider tradition is seen in the fool a traveler walking left toward the end of a cliff and a lone nod to the caryyale visconti tradition in death the characteristic bony figure on a horse wielding a scythethe minor arcanas depict the story of four secret kingdoms presented in the little white book  the kingdom of pleasure chalices the kingdom of richness pentacles the kingdom of sorrow swords and the kingdom of the work of man wandsthis deck is recommended for those tarot collectors who like a gothic theme  it comes in a fitting box and includes a little white book|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this beautifully illustrated tarot is the creation of stephanie puimun law  the imagery in these cards exudes an ethereal quality like no other tarot that i have ever seen  in spite of the superb imagery this deck doesnt depart much from the rider tarot traditionthese cards are bordered in gray numbered and labeled at the bottom  the back of these cards is reversible showing the classical depiction of a sun surrounded by an ornate ring which gives out an aura over a purpleblack and starry spacethe major arcana are numbered with roman numerals  labeled with the standard naming convention from the rider tarot these cards certainly follow this tradition in a spectacular way  for example the tower shows a city and within the city a tree stand taller than anything  at the top of the tree there is a tower being struck down by lightinghowever i thought that the superb ethereal imagery could have inspired and easily justified a name change of a few of the major arcana  for example death shows a phoenix like creature perching on a tree while the hierophant shows an ent like creature sitting on the branchthe suits on the minor arcana swords wands cups and pentacles corresponding element air fire water and earth are subtly integrated within the scenery of the cards  the court cards follow the standard naming convention of page knight queen and king  my favorite cards from the court must be knights with the knight of swords riding a swan the knight of wands riding a horned lion the knight of cups riding an unicorn on high surf and the knight of pentacles riding a earth dragonoverall i am very satisfied with this deck  this deck comes with a little white book|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our grandson had been really looking forward to the arrival of the sodor search  rescue playset and getting harold captain butch flynn rocky  belle out of his makeshift barracks for them and into their own home  while the real sodor search  rescue center has a landing pad for harold a shed for rocky and a dock for captain this playset doesnt  but our grandson got creative and added to it with his legos  our first impression was that it was another great colorful playset with nice attention to detail and it is bright blue green  red along with the majority of the track in silvergrey and a goldish base to the centre itself  the centre is tierd the top tier has sodor search and rescue printed in red above a red paintedon door the ssrc emblem above one of  windows on one side plain light grey on the other side with  windows and with a green portion of track running through it that folds out into a downward incline and connects to the silver track  in has a lever that you lift to send flynn included down the track to put out two fires which are supposed to flip down as he passes by them  the bottom tier of the centre has another paintedon red door on one side and the inside has painted on search  rescue type of equipment ladders fire extinguishers an alarm bell axes hoses first aid kits and  shelves underneath a sign that says supplies holding oxygen masks search lights firehats etc  you can connect it to other sets or track at two points coming out of the centre itself and at the end of the silver track loop  unfortunately the downward incline isnt steep enough to give flynn the momentum he needs to round the curve and put out both fires  not a big deal  our grandson didnt mind pushing flynn  or others  along  this set made its debut on the  collector checklist  we paid  for our grandsons which seemed decent especially since our order qualified for the free shippingupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that fall into what ive come to categorize as an intermediate range of between  and they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds knapford station knapford holiday celebration sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop thomas treasure hunt adventure thomas shark exhibit paxton at the blue mountain stone shed and arctic exhibit  the great thing about these sets and those i categorize as basic with under  msrps is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets and even the intermediate sets relatively so and take them with us on excursionsa little of our own thomas history as first time grandparents my husband and i wanted to start some type of collection for our grandson that he could possibly pass along to his own kids one day  our grandson was   at the time and had been talking a lot about a certain train named thomas a little fella whom  now seems hard to believe  wed never heard of  after doing some research it seemed the takenplay line might be the perfect investment to engage and encourage his active imagination as well as provide a fun way for us to interact with him  what a rewarding decision weve had so much fun together with this quality line of trains vehicles and playsets  hes now  and a large portion of our basement has become a wonderful sodor land of make believe that we all enjoy visiting  and continues to hold his interest which is quite a feat given the tendency at that age to move in and out of toy phases so quickly|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if you had any quibbles at all about nerfs praxis this gun should certainly solve any problems the praxis has a tendency to wobble a bit when firing thus throwing off your aim however this lumitron is steady eddie  the magazine is longer making it much easier to grip reload and insert and the discs if youre new to these discs they look like minifrisbees about the size of a quarter are real glowinthedark ammo no more of that putting a glowing sticker on the darts like nerf normally requires plus this gun shoots farther than the praxis making your target more difficult to miss but you still cannot hit someone with it without it hurting quite a bit  goggles and a vest are a must if using it for dart tag  it does shoot quite accurately to about  feet  after that its a hit or miss thing even though it claims to glide to  feet which it does but goes a bit astraywhat an improvement over the praxis but if you already have the praxis keep in mind that this gun is built exactly the same way but with the above noted improvements yes this is also a pump and shoot gun like the praxis also the extension that comes with the praxis fits very nicely on the lumitron as well  unless you really want to improve the praxis may i suggest the nitron its a bit bigger and more substantial and overall a different gun but if glowinthedark you need batteries too  aas by the way to play in the dark since the magazine lights up your disc thus making them ready to glow  in blue no less sooo cool yeah thanks nerf and steady aiming is your passion then donate your praxis to the salvation army and grab this guy youll certainly be glad you did highly recommend|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily one of the best star wars vehicles hasbro has made yet of course its awesome as the only example of a true sith ship we ever see in the films however hasbro did a particularly good job i really appreciate the fact that hasbro did not sacrifice the design or dimensions of the ship just so it could fit a figure i hated how the old millennium falcon had a huge cockpit and relatively tiny hull by contrast this ship almost looks like a model and is a nearly perfect replica of the one from the moviehaving said that there is a hidden missile launcher when you pull open the hull i guess this is for kids but even when i was a kid i hated when hasbro added these types of features on vehicles fortunately if you keep the hull closed its fairly inconspicuous i just pretend it doesnt existi did see that other reviewers complained about the size of the ship all i have to say is get real hasbro is not going to make a huge version of this ship  the company knows not enough people would pay for it this ship is rare enough to find and costs a good deal secondhand i got mine off ebay for a reasonable price but many are sold for double what i paid so no the ship is not scale to the darth maul figure however as a fan of the old action fleet line it is scale to the action fleet figures thus you could just use it as a ship versus say the naboo starfighter or the droid fighters i dont even bother to put my darth maul figure in the cockpit which is basically just greyoverall definitely get this ship if you are a fan of star wars vehicles  or if you have fond memories of the action fleet line|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this obi wan figure is from the vintage collection from phantom menace movie the sculpt of the face has a good resemblance to ewan mcgregor the rest of the body is well sculpted as well in particular the clothes are well detailed  this  figure also wears a removable fabric robethis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hipsthis figure also includes a lightsaber and a communicatoroverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this version of quigon is probably better than those that have come before but its not quite as good as the quality of the other vintage figures the head sculpt looks a bit dated and a bit too small or his legs too big the lightsaber handle is also way too thick overall its not a horrible figure but just doesnt seem up to snuff with the quality of the vintage line|ham
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|with christmas around the corner i went to the stores to do some early christmas shopping and found a few star wars figures to take home among them i got quigon from the vintage collectionthis figure is quigon jinn from the phantom menace film  i must admit that im not that fond of quigon jinn as a character but i bought it for completeness  this is the better one from the bunch i was able to find in the store the other one being from the saga legend collection  the face of the figure is well sculpted and it has a passing resemblance to liam neeson  it wears a hooded robe that can be removed the rest of the body is well sculpted as well the clothes in particular are well detailed including actual fabric from the waist downthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees ankles and torso and swivel wrists and hipshowever the sculpted tunic shoulders limit the movement of the arms straight up in the other hand this figure has great grip with both hands and can hold the light saber single handed or dual handedoverall this figure offers ok likeness and good posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ratts tyerell certainly isnt the greatest podracer figure hasbro has made but this guy came out well enough he doesnt have much articulation but at least he does have wrist joints his visor fits well over his head and you can even see his eyes through the clear plastic in some ways the red pit droid included with ratts is even more exciting hasbro repainted the  red pit droid to make it look brand new moreover he stands up  my old pit droids would never stand up without assistance while i can recommend ratts tyerell for fans of the pod racing scene dont get your hopes up too high for this little guy|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its amazing but there hadnt been a new darth maul sculpt for years and all of those were horrible finally with the rerelease of episode i in d darth maul gets vintage treatment and finally he looks like a figure worthy of his character the horns are prominent and very well sculpted the paint application is very clean although the black pupils in his eyes are a bit too small on our version with all of the articulation you can pose maul in almost any fighting stance my only complaint with this figure is the lightsaber  it seems the blades are too short still this is definitely the maul figure to get|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|with christmas around the corner i went to the stores to do some early christmas shopping and found a few star wars figures to take home among them i got darth maul from the vintage collectionthis figure is darth maul from the phantom menace film  i must admit that darth maul was my favorite character from episode   after removing the highly detailed rubbery plastic hood i discovered that the face of this figure is well sculpted and has a great resemblance to darth maul from the movie  it wears a black fabric robe that can also be removed  the rest of the body is well sculpted as well the clothes in particular are well detailed including actual fabric from the waist downthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows hips knees ankles and torso and swivel wristsit has great grip with both hands and can hold the double light saber single handed or dual handed  it also include an unlit double light saber and a scanneroverall this figure offers ok likeness and is very posable|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this figure is darth sidious from the phantom menace film with the hood on this figure could pass as the emperor seen on the return of the jediout of the box this figure comes wearing a highly detailed rubbery plastic hood and a black fabric robe both of them removable after removing the hood i discovered that the sculpt of the face holds good resemblance to ian mcdiamir there are no scars since this is yet to happen the body is also well sculpted the clothes resembling the black jedi tunic including fabric from the waist down to avoid hindering the hipsthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel wrists torso and hipsit has a great grip in both hands and can hold the red lightsaber single handed this figure also include an unlit lightsaber that the figure can wear on its beltoverall this figure offers good likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ok little anakin as a padawan was probably not on the top of everybodys wishlist but this figure is extremely well done hasbro used a mix of soft cloth and plastic for the shirt which looks extremely realistic the accessories including the padawan helmet and training droid are cool extras even though they were never in the movie id definitely recommend this little guy for your collection if you like highquality star wars figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|to be quite honest ive never been a big fan of ben quadrinaros as a character he looks absolutely ridiculous and does nothing in the films except have his podracer stall on him he certainly wouldnt have been on my wishlist for hasbro charactershowever upon seeing this figure in a store i soon fell in love hasbro did an amazing job with ben the sculpt and paint detail are incredible he looks extremely realistic more so even than the animated version in the movie his skin is creased and wrinkled while his suit looks like its made of some leathery fabric as a piece of art this figure is stunning if you take to collecting star wars figures like artwork then ben is definitely a worthy addition to your collection even if you dont like the actual character|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|hasbro hasnt made too many nemoidians but sure made up for it with the love given to daultay dofine his clothes look absolutely real i love the way hasbro added multiple layers to the robe also hasbro really captured the look of concern and worry that always plagues nemoidian faces in the movies this is one of my favorite figures ever definitely a must for fans of the prequels|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure is definitely a huge leap from the  version of the naboo royal guard hes got all the articulation of modern figures his jacket is brilliantly painted with deep red and black highlights my only complaint is that the face looks a bit blaseacute the paint job is fine but not particularly interesting something seems a bit off maybe thats best for an army building figure but its definitely not quite as realistic as some of the other figures in the line|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this naboo royal guard figure is from the vintage collection from phantom menace movie  i bought this figure to add to a collection of guards from all  star wars movies which also includes senate guardii rebel fleet trooperiv imperial navy trooperiv and emperors royal guard vioverall the sculpt and paint on this figure is very good with excellent details on its jacket gloves and boots  this figure wears a helmet which is removablethis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel gloves waist and hipsthis figure also includes a blaster that fits well in the holster attached to its beltoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|quinlon vos is an eu favorite but did make a cameo in phantom menace hasbro did this figure justice as with many of the figures in the vintage line the detail and sculpt are incredible his skirt is a mix of cloth and plastic which looks great the best part is his hair it really looks like he has curly dreadlocks overall a fun addition for fans of this complex character|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|as much as i like some of the clone wars figures opress ventress i can never get used to the humans their features are too angular as such i really appreciate hasbros making some of the key humanoid characters like anakin in realistic form this figure came out very well and can stand alongside any other figure in the hasbro line anakin looks like christian haydenson in between aotc and rots with longer hair but not yet down to his shoulders my only small complaint is that theres no way to attach the lightsaber handle to anakins belt thats become an almost standard feature for jedi other than that a neat figure looking forward to more realistic clone wars figures|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|with christmas around the corner i went to the stores to do some early christmas shopping and found a few star wars figures to take home  among them i got anakin skywalker for the vintage collection which i was planning to order nextaccording to the packaging this figure is anakin from the clone wars era  however it is not sculpted as seen in the animated series but from a more realistic look  as such the sculpt of the face has a some resemblance to hayden christensen  the rest of the body is well sculpted as well the clothes in particular are well detailed including actual fabric from the waist downthis figure has balljointed neck ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel wrists torso and hipshowever the shoulder pads limit the movement of the arms straight up  in the other hand this figure has great grip with both hands and can hold the lightsaber single handed or dual handed  this figure includes an unlit saber but only for holdingoverall this figure offers good likeness and is very posable|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|there have been dozens of versions of darth vader figures over the years this figure is easily the best one to come from hasbro yet its got an incredible amount of articulation the sculpt and paint are incredible perhaps the best thing about the figure is that it is the new hope version with no removable helmet meaning you can pose it a lot without worrying about that helmet another great feature is that vader can grip the lightsaber with both hands unlike other recent figures that could only grip with the left hand definitely must get this one for your collection|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this darth vader is from the original star wars film retitled a new hope this figure is very well sculpted with highly detailed chest box and belt and subtly red hued lens on the helmetout of the box this figure wears a black fabric cape and skirt  of course it also includes a red lightsaberthis figure has ballhinged shoulders elbows hips knees and ankles and swivel head waist and forearmsoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability  it is arguably the most accurate and articulated darth vader there is|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|finally weve got an imperial navy commander that is screen accurate has versatile articulation and correctly proportioned hes hard to find but if you can find him its worth getting a few for death star dioramas my only complaint is that underneath the helmet the figure has blondish hair it doesnt contrast very well against the light skin tone i think he would have looked better with brown or black hair|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|with christmas around the corner i went to the stores to do some early christmas shopping and found a few star wars figures to take home  among them i got yoda from movie heroes collection  it comes in a similar packaging as figures from the clone wars collection except the bottom is red insteadaccording to the packaging this is yoda from the revenge of the sith film  the sculpt of the face and body are very detailed  the included rubberyplastic cape is well detailed and attaches into a square hole between yodas shoulders  the cape can swivel up or down but it only touches yodas shoulder when the hem of the cape is up  i prefer to have it removed but then yoda has a gaping hole in the back  the right hand has a light saber permanently attached but it can be replaced with the spare one to hold the canethis figure has very limited mobility with swivel head shoulders elbows right wrist and torso but no articulated left wrist hips knees or anklesor separate legs for that matter  this is because the upper portion can be twisted around so at the push of the head the figure whirls it saber back  at least that is what the instructions recommend  i figured that if instead you hold the lower portion and push down it does a better swirl maneuver  may be ok for gaming but if you are looking for a figure of yoda for posing you are stuck with standing poses and a few at bestoverall this figure offers great likeness but very limited poses  its not that bad  however beware of the figures in the movie hero collection if you are turned off with gimmicks such as whirling or slashing light saber  torso twist on the push of a button light up light saber  the light saber is permanently attached to the handnot bad gimmicks for fun but a turn off for collectors|ham

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter got a gift card to a store for her birthday and picked this playset she has thepinypon  caravan playsetand several other smaller sets so this went along great with what she already had the hotel is big but can be opened up and then closed so as to facilitate carrying around to playdates and suchlike some other reviewers have commented there are tons of stickers which come in several sheets though there is a sheet with a picture of the hotel playset and numbers indicating which sticker goes where the stickers themselves have weak adhesive and so the result is that after going to all the trouble of placing them on the respective areas they fell off i finally remedied this by placing glue dots on the backs of the stickers so that they would stay in place but it took me awhilewhen you open the packaging box there are several plastic bags containing all the different parts and accessories the hotel itself comes assembled but there are smaller pieces that need to be attached to the hotel and theres a guide showing how to do this though its not too difficult to figure it out it took my eightyearold daughter and i more than an hour to put everything together as well as placing the stickers where they were supposed to beultimately it was worth it because my daughter absolutely enjoys the set which ties in well with her interest in playing makebelieve and coming up with creative stories she especially enjoys playing with this set on playdates with her friends since there are lots of tiny and small accessories i think this set is more suited to children ages  and up|ham
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter received this as an th birthday present and i found that this is sold at a local retail store for under twenty dollars so comparison shopping is advised there are many tiny toys that come with this set such as a little cutlery set tiny plastic drinking cups etc so it is not advisable for children under  the set itself is awesome as it has tons of features the caravan comes completely assembled but can be taken apart to play with for example the top can come off and the two surfboards can be taken off the cool thing is the surfboards have wheels on them and the pinypon figure that comes with the set can be placed on it theres a little groove for the pinypon dolls foot to go on and voila the pinypon doll is set to go on the ride of her lifetheres a little beach chair that the doll can sit on two little sleeping bunkers attached to the caravan a builtin refrigerator with doors that can open and you can place the little food items that come with the set into it drawers that open and close and many more theres also a bunch of stickers that come with this set but the best part is that the sticker sheet is numbered so that you know exactly where to place each sticker i think an older child can manage this independently but younger children might need the help of a parent to place all the stickersthe best part of this caravan is the little attached splashing pool that can be opened out and filled with water theres a little attached hose and shower head which when submerged into the pool for a while is able to squirt out water to shower the pinypon doll you have to press the attached pump to get the water going its simple really and great fun my daughter got this as a birthday present and she loves playing with it and taking it on playdates great great fun|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the rebel alliance certainly had its share of heroes in a new hope and the empire strikes back however something always seemed a bit odd the rebels were fighting for freedom from oppression and discrimination yet apparently no aliens had joined the rebel cause where were all the oppressed rodians and snivvians flocking to the rebel bandwagon were they all just hanging out in chalmuns cantina drinking their sorrows away alas return of the jedi introduced the first rebel aliens on the bridge of home one we see sullustans dressellians and of course mon calamari by giving admiral ackbar such a prominent role the mon calamari became the symbol of the rebellion  even hosting capitol of the new republic after the yuuzhan vong invasion however with the release of star wars on bluray we learned that george lucas was far from confident that the puppets used for the mon calamari would work onscreen in fact several scenes were filmed with general crix madine taking ackbars place on the bridge of home one  fortunately puppeteer tim rose did a phenomenal job bringing ackbar to life the bluray bonus features also include test scenes with an unidentified mon calamari  also performed by tim rose  piloting what looks like awing unfortunately this brave rebel pilot did not make it into the final cutto celebrate the release of those deleted scenes hasbro gave the mon calamari pilot the attention he deserves in s deleted scene wave wave  from what we can tell he is an allnew sculpt hasbro did not simply throw the mon calamari parts from the vintage admiral ackbar vc onto a preexisting awing pilots uniform comparing this figure with tycho celchu or green leaders uniforms its clear the rebel pilot mon calamari has a different uniform the tube connecting the chestbox to the belt is white not a metallic silver the white leg straps also hang on the figure more realistically almost as if drooping down the outer parts of his legs the shoes are also much larger perhaps because mon calamari have larger feet overall we think this version of the awing pilots uniform works better for the figure except for the chestbox the chestbox is smaller and flatter than those found on most rebel pilots also the buttons are not painted in the robinegg blue red and white colors that characterize tycho celchus chestbox of course its not clear from the test footage what this pilots chestbox actually looked like but we wish hasbro had just taken the chestbox from one of these other figures to make it look visually more interestingeven though the vintage admiral ackbar was one of our favorites hasbro decided to give this mon calamari pilot all new head and arms perhaps most notable is that the rebel pilots spotting pattern is a darker shade of brown while we think sometimes the spotting comes across as a bit too bold and doesnt bleed enough into the lighter brown it does effectively distinguish him from ackbar the head sculpt is definitely superior to ackbars and better emphasizes some of the mon calamaris features including his chin tendrils the pilots mouth opens wider than ackbars as if hes saying friend calamari tonight one of tim roses lines in the deleted scene the hands have bonier fingers and the jagged portions off his forearm are sharper than ackbars of course as with all mon calamari not named ackbar this pilot comes with a helmet its pretty faithful to the onscreen version except its missing the small microphone extending from the righthand side still the design is reminiscent of the helmets from the potf mon calamari fleet officers speaking of which customizers will want to get multiple copies of this figure in order to create more mon calamari officers its not a great fit but you can put the rebel pilots head on the admiral ackbar neck and put a little clay on the joint to keep it in place while its a shame this rebel pilot never made it into the final film were very pleased with the way hasbro immortalized him in plastic|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my  year old is an enduring thomas the tank engine fan but his second love has been the disney animated series jake and the neverland pirates which is based in peter pans neverland and peter pan guests in a couple of episodes  the only problem was that they only had one season for a long time and he grew tired of it after frequent rewatches  however recently there have been quite a few new episodes featuring jake izzy cubby skully captain hook smee sharky and bones that he has absolutely loved  my toddler likes it for the music which is very upbeat and funso you can guess how ecstatic my  year old was when he opened the amazon box and foundbucky  i couldnt get the ties off the back of the packaging fast enough to get bucky out for him  he played with it all night then took bucky jake and skully to bed  after that he and bucky were inseparable he even begged me to let him take bucky to school  i know that this is one toy he is going to play with for a long timethen at the end of the week i was an idiot i had my toddler in the bath and my son asked if he could get in  i told him he could once i got the little girl out  i was so busy drying her off that i didnt realizehe took bucky into the bath with him  bucky must have been submerged a full two minutes before i plucked him out  i touched the button that makes the soundsnothing  i felt so awfulwe took out the  aa batteries that bucky comes with and left him out to dry   hours later i put the batteries in andit works  i am so relieved  i am sure that the designers of this toy anguished over whether to make the first bucky a floating boat for the bath or a highend toy with electronics and im glad they made it a highend toy  there are so many responses when you push the gold doubloon button that it never seems repetitious  there is a ships bell sound and lots of music and jake talking such as woohoo and set sail for pirate island followed by music and water cannons go and bucky turn right  its great because my toddler loves it toothe good lots of different fun inspiring voices and sounds from the tv series jake and skully to play with on the ship both have slots on the bottom so you can perch them around the ship where there are pegs nearly indestructible  bucky has been dropped wrestled over and submerged and everything still works great and no broken parts interactive features three gold doubloon buttons one for sound one to launch the missles and one to open the port with tick tock the crocodile comes with  missles which have a large rounded front and launch with enough force to be fun but not enough to hurt anyone caught in the crosshairs has rollers on the bottom so he can sail around your house just make sure to have the water  bad conversation when rolled bucky rocks back and forth like he is sailing back door to put the characters ini dont really see any bad things  its pricey but i think the value is there  you can get other characters such asfisherprice disneys jake and the neverland pirates  jake izzy and cubby pirate packand other pieces such asfisherprice disneys jake and the neverland pirates  hooks battle boat  i need to getfisherprice disneys jake and the neverland pirates  jake hook and croc pirate packso that my  year old can act out captain hook being deviousi have attached a video so you can see the size and hear some of the sound effects my son uses jake to push down on the gold doubloon|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|overall reviewthe dream townhouse is roomy spacious has beautiful color options beyond pink and white a nice blue hottub and middle section for example takes up little floor space by climbing the wall and has the dealbreaker for most kids the working elevator  but assemblers are advised to put in batteries and test all electronics flushing toilet crackling fireplace etc before assembling that is sadly a necessity for all modern barbie electronic toys since quality does vary greatlydeciding on a new home for barbiethe townhouse malibu dreamhouse beach house glam vacation house pink world house fashion fairytale palace lightup castle etc all offer something different for barbie  in particular the townhouse is a much better deal when compared to the malibu dreamhouse  for about  more barbie gets an elevator a lot more furniture and a house that takes up more wall space than floor space  as well the townhouse suits barbie scale much better than the malibu dreamhouse which can feel a bit crowded  the glam vacation house and pink world house dont have much in the way of ceilings or floors mostly just walls so girls dont really feel like they have a house  my  year old never really liked the pink house  it took up too much room in her floor and since it didnt have much of a floor furniture fell over constantly on carpet  as for the fairytale dvd movie houses they are built specifically for a character and regular barbies may seemfeel very out of place  the dream townhouse gives plenty of roominess for a variety of the more inexpensive barbies such as the fashionistas whose articulated arms and legs go well with the townhouseassembling the dream townhouseas noted above install batteries and check all electronics before assembling  mattel does have an assembly video that you can access as well   version dream townhouse to get an idea of how to put it together  but honestly it wasnt that hard  mattel has been smart and designed it such that you match up shapes to pieces and pieces all come in different widths so they wont snap into the wrong place  this was the same case with the monster high school playset and made sure that you assembled once and were done ikea has also gone this route thankfully  assembly ideally takes  minutes at most including taking out of the package  the graphics are setalready there thankfully so no annoying stickers to put togetherdurabilitythe houses of the past tended to be put together in roomsized pieces and so broke down fairly easily due to lack of a solid base  the dream townhouse comes with one solid  floor wall piece with folding permanently attached floors  this gives some durability to the house  once the floors are dropped it is held together by the thick columns on each level  the penthouse level then fits onto the second floor top  the elevator has a track and fortunately the new design means that sagging parts dont cause it to fall out as easily  the newer softer less brittle plastics of today often mean that the floors give a bit and this does cause the elevator to be a bit creaky and stiff especially compared to the dream houses with elevators from the s the softer plastics also seem to contribute to the variations in track sizes for the elevators  often requiring a bit of modification if your elevator doesnt work well or as designed but that said this is much better quality than the previous dream townhouseaestheticsits great to see barbie adding in more colors than pink or white though there was an odd yellow fold out house in the s  this townhouse has blue flooring in the middle and a large blue tub on top and there are some purples thrown in for variety plus many shades of pinks  dark to light  add interest  note that the color isnt as saturated as in the images on amazon so it isnt as eye wincingly bright  the house is a good scale for barbie and the dolls dont feel crowded though ken might be a bit tall for the middle level  as well it makes a beautiful display for barbies when not in playalternativesthis is the top of the line barbie house and is priced accordingly  keep in mind that there are other alternatives if you dont wantneed the barbie branding or would like a house not made of plastic  kidcraft has an excellent line of full wood with full color graphics doll houses that are priced comparably to this house  those doll houses are also barbiescale and ideal for a larger doll collection that may include moxie bratz etcsummaryin all this is an improvement and provides more value for money than the other barbie houses  quality variation issues keep this from being a  star product as well as the hefty price  the elevator doesnt always work well and the electronics especially may not all work|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|neca did an incredible job with this figure the detailing is extremely realistic if you rub your finger along the body it feels like rough wrinkled skin neca also managed to get quite a bit of articulation including wrist leg elbow shoulder and two neck joints one at the base and one near the head et is around  inches tall but hes a pretty bulky figure and looks quite largethe galactic friend figure comes with a wraparound towel the towel is moulded not cloth so you can really only dress et up in it one way however it looks great on him it can be removed to get a naked version of et one warning with the towel is that at a few points some of the white paint rubbed onto the figure i was initially pretty upset but i noticed that just rubbing those spots with a wet cloth completely removed the white paint and solved the problemthis figure also comes with a neck extension so you can make the neck longer it looks great although admittedly is a bit tough to get on you have to position the ball in the ball socket straight so you can push it in my advice is to just switch to the longer neck and leave itmy only complaint is that the small reeses pieces accessory doesnt have a label its just an orange bag of candy the trademark was probably left off for legal reasons still thats a pretty small complaintit took  years but finally we have an et figure worth of the film well worth the price|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|unfortunately i found myself a bit disappointed with this figure id hoped neca would have updated its paint process for gizmo based on negative reviews of the earlier gizmo figure unfortunately this gizmo has some of the same paint smudges along the border between the white and brown fur its not too bad from far away but just looks sloppy up close the accessories are tiny and look fragile even worse they dont fit well in gizmos hands and i dont want to press them in for fear of breaking them overall this figure has potential but as it is i wouldnt recommend it for either kids or collectors|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|weve been doing some early christmas shopping for our grandson and were really looking forward to doing a little prechristmas testing out of s twist  tumble cargo drop making its debut on the  collector checklist having been so delighted with another  now that its in front of us we wouldnt put it on the same level as dieselworks due to an immediately apparent mechanical glitch as well as the fact that theres only one place to connect it up to other sets or track compared to three on dieselworks  but grandma  grandpa were able to doctor it up to where its workable glad we found out ahead of time and were sure hell enjoy having its featured building the smelters where old engine parts are melted down as another place for his trains to visit  the  price free shipping seemed relatively reasonablethough not as bright as some of the other sets about twothirds of it is the mostly grey smelters shed and the grey scurvedinclined track it gets little punches of color here and there  paxton deep green with yellow lining black cab red base   black wheels and his yellow cargo car with  black wheels  both included  start out at the top of the smelters shed where you place his cargo of old train parts into a yellow lever scoop when you lift the lever it sends paxton and his car down and around the scurve incline while his cargo drops into a yellow cargo bucket midway through the curve paxton pushes through a yellow trip gate which triggers the bucket to drop the cargo down the goldishorange chute and into the matching smelting furnace paxton arrives at the bottom halted by a yellow stop gate to collect the supposedly now melted iron cargo the furnace has a grey door at the bottom that you lift up to release the cargo into paxtons car  pretty clever  the glitch was that the iron cargo which is colored orange we suppose because its supposed to be so hot its glowing is a hollow piece of lightweight plastic honestly its the cheapest thing weve seen in the tnp line unfortunately and not only is it too light to propel down the chute but on half of our attempts it actually just popped right out of the bucket and onto the floor  our solution was to pull a piece of silly putty mold it to the inside of the hollow area placing a piece of tape at the bottom so it wouldnt stick to the lever  waalaa  the cargo is now weighted enough that it tumbles down the chute and into the furnace as intended  other details are windows and fan vents on the shed through which you see the orangeyellow glow of fire a couple of green panels on the front of the shed the letters d and w near the top for diesel works maybe with a circular emblem in between depicting melted iron being poured and across from the cargo door theres a light brown panel that pops into the set to keep paxton from flying off the track and serves as a partition between the track and a rocky area where we guess paxton takes his lunch breaks  theres a passageway underneath the shed with enough width and height to run an additional piece of track through  we know our grandson will come up with clever ways to incorporate this into his island of sodor  were thinking this is where hell also keep iron arry and iron bert  it wouldve made sense to include them in this set since they work at the smelters but that would prevent us from having to purchase them separately now wouldnt it    maybe they have an overabundance of paxtons since hes also included in another  set   paxton at the blue mountain stone shedupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that fall into what ive come to categorize as an intermediate range of between  and they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds knapford station knapford holiday celebration sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop thomas treasure hunt adventure thomas shark exhibit paxton at the blue mountain stone shed and arctic exhibit  the great thing about these sets and those i categorize as basic with under  msrps is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets and even the intermediate sets relatively so and take them with us on excursionswe were first time grandparents of a   year old when my husband and i began a tnp collection for our grandson hoping hed pass it along to his own kids one day  weve all had a great time interacting with this overall quality line of trains vehicles and playsets  he turned  at the end of april and still enjoys spending a couple of hours of each day he spends with us in the sodor land of make believe that spans a large portion of our basement  although disneys cars characters are beginning to occupy a different portion its nice to see our investment continuing to hold his interest engaging and encouraging that active imagination  grandson  came along in march so we plan to continue collecting tnp for several years to come|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|like the yuuzhan vong figure that came with the  comic pack hasbro did an excellent job crafting and detailing this nom anor however the nom anor figure is overall a more accurate representation of the species the figure is smaller and the body proportions are less comicbookish also hasbro painted striking blue tatoos on his head the chest plate is painted a beautiful light brown with blue dots the only part that bothers us is the hands  the paint color doesnt quite match the yellowish skin tone on the face its not too blatant and really only becomes noticeable under bright lights still it does make us wonder if perhaps hasbro decided to repaint the head before release indeed the head on the final figure does look a bit different from the one in the prototype photosinterestingly the prototype figures we saw in early  depicted nom anor wearing a plastic cloak while the plastic cloak seemed to fit more snugly around his head were glad hasbro decided to go with the softgoods cloak we like the way it drapes behind him the cloak has a hole in the back so you can put his back spikes on over the cloak this looks great from the front although from behind it looks a bit odd then again according to the books the cloak is an organic lifeform so its possible it shapes itself around the spikes one thing we noticed is that if you remove the cloak and chest plate the figure looks more like a generic vong if you like the njo its worth getting multiple copies as vong army builders  frankly this is probably the closest hasbro will ever get to releasing a realistic generic yuuzhan vong figure|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|based on the review at jedi temple archive i was worried about this figure however i actually like it a lot the biggest problem is the neck joint  hasbro made a big hole at the base of jar jars neck so you can move it around but if the neck is pushed back you can see the hold fortunately ive found that if you push the neck forward it actually looks pretty good i love the detail on jar jars head and arms it would be great if hasbro produced a version without the hole in the neck but in the meantime this is the best version of that crazy gungan out there|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|neca did an incredible job with these figures the detailing is extremely realistic if you rub your finger along the body it feels like rough wrinkled skin neca also managed to get quite a bit of articulation including wrist leg elbow shoulder and two neck joints one at the base and one near the head et is around  inches tall but hes a pretty bulky figure and looks quite largethe beer buddy figure wears with a moulded plaid shirt it doesnt come off it generally looks pretty good on him but looks a bit thin around the shoulders he comes with two accessories a game pad and gerties daises this figure also comes with a neck extension so you can make the neck longer it looks great although admittedly is a bit tough to get on you have to position the ball in the ball socket straight so you can push it in my advice is to just switch to the longer neck and leave itthe thing i love most about this figure is the face rather than simply using the same head as the night flight figure this et is clearly drunk and dazed just like in the movie the mouth is slightly open and you can even see his teeth as opposed to the other et figures smile its awesome that neca took the time and effort to add that amount of detailthe night flight figure comes with a wraparound towel the towel is moulded not cloth so you can really only dress et up in it one way however it looks great on him it can be removed to get a naked version of et sadly the figure doesnt come with the neck extension only with the short neck you could always take the neck extension from the other figure but its still odd that neca didnt give this figure any other accessoriesit took  years but finally we have an et figure worthy of the film well worth the price|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|amazon originally listed this right at fisherprices summer   msrp but in our original  review we stated it looked really flimsy and that grandpa  i would wait to see if it came down in price before adding it to the takenplay collection we started for our grandson the year it came out   when it went down to  we went ahead and purchased it hoping to be pleasantly surprised  suffice it to say  we werentweve noticed fp taking shortcuts and cheapening various aspects of this product line especially over the past year or so but in our opinion this is positively the worst product theyve put out  first of all they create an item for two trains to race down but only include one train luring the customer to purchase another train separately  while this wasnt an issue for us personally weve collected every train theyve manufactured for our grandson let us assure you that not only is it as flimsy as it looked it doesnt even operate as stated  youre supposed to be able to put  trains in the starting tray adjust the yellow switch gates to the desired lane track lift the starting tray and see who reaches the finish line designated by two blue flags first  flags are attached to a piece of track that can be connected to additional takenplay track or playsets you purchase separately  we attempted this with percy and thomas fifty times and not once did both of them even make it past the switch gates  one or both always got stuck on one of the switch gates  it makes you wonder whether the designers at fp have been given carte blanche control over what the company puts out without any oversight or review committee  by the way we ordered it on  here it is just  days later and amazon must be getting a slew of complaints and returns because theyve already dropped the price down to  less than fps msrp for their simple track packs  that was a smart decision because you cant claim somethings a playset when you cant play with it as describedyes it does close up to takenplay with percy snaps into the support piece underneath the rd section of track but we are quite certain that our grandson will have no interest in taking this anywhere  when youve really believed in a product line and invested so much money into it its a sad day when you see proof of its decline in such an extraordinary way  wed felt that wed be collecting this line for many years to come the grandson we started it for is now  but he has a  year old brother wholl be growing into the products soon and wed planned to continue purchasing as long as interest was maintained but it looks like the four years it took for them to go from a quality product line to this point will be the extent of our collection  shame on fisherprice for letting what started out as a great line go downhill so quickly and dramaticallyupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that have msrps of under   they are in order of introduction  the original version of the toteatrain playbox colin at the wharf thomas at the farm percys mail delivery tidmouth tunnel toby at trotters farm sir handel at great waterton sodor engine wash talking diesels fuel  freight delivery sodor paint shop around the rails with thomas muddy adventure go go speedy railway skip it sodor lumber company treasure tracks a new version of the toteatrain playbox skip this too and brendam docks  the beauty of these tnp playsets is that he can choose one to easily disconnect from the others fold up and take with us on excursions  theyre definitely the simplest to take n play with|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this special action figure set is one of the last hasbro will make under the vintage banner unlike the others which recycled old versions of the main characters this one actually has characters we havent seen in a while there have been other versions of rd and the death star droid but these ones are by far the best versions the rd is not the buildadroid version but rather a repaint of the  version it looks great the paint has slightly less weathering and dirt but that makes this version useful for any number of dioramas the dearth star droid is the buildadroid one of the figures in this set its the weakest as it sometimes has trouble standing up however its the power droid that is really the star of this pack we havent received a power droid figure in years and this one is phenomenal the dirt and weathering make this droid look old and used moreover the top comes off revealing the droids innards  a very cool feat overall this set is definitely required if you have any diorama with jawas|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|since i started collection on late november  i missed a lot of great figures the first time around fortunately special action figure sets like this one allow me to get good remakes of the classic figures from kennerthis droid set includes a rd a death star droid and a power droid from a new hope movie granted there is not a lot of action in these figures but at the prices these are currently going in amazon it would be a shame to let them passthe rd is a good update to the vintage figure this figure has swivel head hips and ankles it includes a removable third leg and antennathe death star droid is the most interesting figure in this mix the original vintage version was shinier but it wasnt as articulated as this one this figure has ballhinged elbows torso and knees and swivel head shoulders and hips but no articulated wrists or ankles in my opinion this is as much articulation as a droid needs on the plus side the hands seems usable although lom takes the cake i would be happy if hasbro swaps the head and paint it goldfinally there is a power droid the original was blue but otherwise this one fit the bill this figure has balljointed hips and anklesoverall this set offers three good figures with great likeness and posability for droids|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our grandsons been mesmerized by sharks since a visit to newport aquarium across the river from cincy on his nd birthday so this set  featuring the sodor aquariums shark exhibit  was a definite hit with him on his th  couple that with his maintaining an interest in the thomas collection we started years ago as well as amazons price of  coming in right at fisherprices summer  msrp of  and it made this purchase a given  the folks at fisherprice really got creative with this one  its another sturdy colorful set blue  gold with the usual grey track and depictions of various sea life in different places with  points where it can be connected up to additional track or other sets  thomas included starts out at the top by entering the sharks large mouth we adults might wonder how he gets up there but im sure little ones will have no trouble pretending harold hoisted him up  when you lift the handle at the back of the sharks head which is also the carrying handle thomas races down and that top track collapses down onto a raised piece of track so that thomas zooms backward into an enclosure that stops him  he can then chug out onto a circular piece of track to collect his load  a little blue rubberish feeling shark in a cargo car  when thomas goes down the track it releases the shark into the cargo car  now this is a different cargo car than those in other playsets its completely plastic and its wheels dont move  you have to insert thomas metal magnet connector into it so its actually raised off the track somewhat as thomas pulls it  very odd  unfortunately we see it as a sign of fp cutting corners which is disappointing  another disappointment is that  contrary to what the photo on the front of the box shows and despite the instructions that say thomas can ride over and attach to the cargo car and transport the shark to his destination there is no short grey piece of track for the cargo car to sit on underneath the picture of the large tank to await the release of the shark or thomas arrival the cargo car is simply placed underneath the tank on the ground and must be manually lifted off of the ground to place onto thomas the closest he gets to it is on the circular track  a more accurate photo is the one on the back of the box  despite those couple of disappointments our grandson was thrilled with the whole shark theme  later on we purchased targets lion  canyon and percys penguin adventure sets  he connects them all up and pretends its sodor zooupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that fall into what ive come to categorize as an intermediate range of between  and they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds knapford station knapford holiday celebration sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop thomas treasure hunt adventure thomas shark exhibit paxton at the blue mountain stone shed and arctic exhibit  the great thing about these sets and those i categorize as basic with under  msrps is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets and even the intermediate sets relatively so and take them with us on excursionsgrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  although recently weve seen a few signs that fp may be cheapening the line using more plastic instead of metal eliminating the chugging sounds of the talking engines as they move along the track etc well keep collecting them as long as he still shows an interest  hell be  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement with his little brother turning  in march it wont be long before hes playing with them too so were likely to be collecting for several years to come  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i usually collect vintage style figures but i can hardly get good multipacks deals on those however with the special action figures sets i got a hit specially since i dont own any of these figuresthe star wars villain set includes sand people boba fett and snaggletooth just because this set includes a vintage style figure of boba fett does it make it a great set not necessarily but if on top of that you get a vintage style figure of sand people and an exclusive vintage style figure of snaggletooth then it is hard to answer with anything but yessand people looks really awesome this figure is covered with a removable fabric robe the overall details are remarkable as well specially the head wrappings and googles it includes a gaderffi stick and blaster rifle this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders knees and ankles and swivel elbows wrists waist and hipsboba fett is a must have in any star wars collection and it sweetens the deal in this set after i remove the rubberyplastic helmet i see that the sculpt of the face is really good i should compare it to jango next in addition the sculpt and paint of the armor does justice to this character along with the fabric cape on top of that its backpack is removable it includes a blaster rifle this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel forearms waist and hipssnaggletooth is really interesting figure the sculpt of this figure is really well done and it just have a passing resemblance to my  years old version of him and that is a good thing the sculpt of the face and clothes is great it includes a blaster pistol this figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows and knees and swivel wrists waist and hipsnote at first snaggletooth stopped me from buying this set because i thought it was not from the vintage collection that is true because it is an exclusive vintage style figure it was a doh moment that i was able to rectifyoverall this set offers three really good figures with great likeness and posability|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|since im trying to collect return of the jedi figures aurra sing didnt register in my radar  not until i got cad bane in a pack that included rd and cpo i liked the stylized version from the clone wars series  then i developed a taste for bounty hunters and undoubtedly i have to stumble upon aurra singthis figure is from the vintage collection aurra sing as seen in the film phantom menace the face has a good resemblance to the character in the film and the body is very detailed as well it even include the antenna  albeit not as thin as with the movie character it looks very well from every directionout of the box this figure wears a plastic vest and a belt with two holster all these are removable it also includes a long rifle two handguns which fit well in their holsters and a suitcase with four slots for lightsaber hilts three of them already occupiedthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows and knees and swivel wrists torso and hips but no articulated anklesoverall this figure offers good likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to like about this figure hasbro seems to have put a lot more thought and care into making him than it does with the regular stormtroopers and clone troopers which often have rubbery and yellowing helmets this republic trooper from the tor mmo is generally an excellent figure the articulation feels very smooth and natural including not just waist articulation but also a swivel chest his armor looks like it has multiple layers of bandoliers shoulder pads and other gear mostly due to hasbros excellent decision to make these separate accessories rather than part of the body moldhowever the figure is a bit frustrating because he cant hold his big gatling gun as naturally as id like you have to bend the handles of the gun a bit so they fit in his hand its not a bit deal but given that the characters most prominent scene features him with his gatling gun i wish hasbro had found a better solution balljointed wrists might have helped|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|when hasbro announced that it was going to make a realistic version of the clone wars obiwan i was skeptical the cw obiwan actually looks quite different from the film version especially with the clonetrooper gear however i think hasbro managed to make this character look both realistic and give it a slightly more cartoonish feel  a perfect mix of cw and prequel the head sculpt is new not just a reused one from the other vintage kenobi figures the bodys also all new overall im really beginning to like the realistic clone wars line|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|after an hiatus of  years i restarted my star wars collection with anakin skywalker based on the clone wars  at that moment i knew i had to get obi wan and ahsoka  fortunately amazon have them and my wait is now overthis figure is obi wan from the clone wars era  this one was sculpted with a realistic look based on the  animated series  as such the sculpt of the face has an amazing resemblance to obi wan character  the rest of the body is well sculpted as well the armor and clothes in particular are well detailed including actual fabric from the waist downthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel waist hips and wriststhis figure has great grip with both hands and can hold the light saber single handed or dual handed this figure also includes an unlit saber but only for holding  however there is no helmetoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|coming on the heels of hasbros ewok pack and twopack we get yet another excellent ewok lumat isnt a new body sculpt and hes somewhat generic for an ewok although the face is new what is really exciting about this little guy is the accessories his spear is new and looks really authentic also his bow can actually hold an arrow making it look like lumat is going to fire it the figure has shoulder elbow wrist and leg articulation which is amazing given how small he is overall hasbro has really nailed the ewoks down|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO| years ago i was collecting figures from the return of the jedi when i stopped  i dont recall why  i didnt get han solo in trench coat or leia in combat poncho what but i got teebo from the last wave i bought from  so there is a lot running on lumat shouldersthis figure is from the vintage collection lumat as seen in the film return of the jedi  i have to say im really impressed on how well sculpted this figure is  the detail on the fur is amazing similar to the sculpt on clone wars chewbacca but compressed to match the reduced sizeout of the box this figure wears a hood with strapped quiver which is removable  it also include a spear a bow and three arrowsthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows hips and ankles swivel wrists and waist but no articulated kneesoverall this figure offers great likeness and good posability  im not a fan of ewoks but i must say that lumat just got me to order logray  let see how that one score next|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|along with the ewoks jabbas skiff guards have been the biggest winners in hasbros vintage line the weequay hunter came out in the power of the force line in the late s and while that was an excellent figure it needed an update with more articulation hasbro delivered and it looks great the face sculpt is even different from the weequay skiff captain figure that came out last year really not much more to say except to congratulate hasbro on such fine figures from this scene over the past few years|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|im trying to complete my return of the jedi collection from  years ago the weequays were not in my list but i want to have at least one of them i got the skiff master first but this is the one i really likethis figure is from the vintage collection weequay skiff guard as seen in the film return of the jedi the head is a very good sculpt pony tail and all  the body is very detailed as well specially its clothes the shoulder pads are part of the shoulder joint so the figure still has full range of motion  unlike the skiff master the tunic below his waist is not long enough to interfere with the hip jointsthis figure also include a staff and a blasterthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows torso knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hipsone thing i have issue with is the off colored hinges behind the knees and ankles  a sharpie can not fix thoseoverall this figure offers great likeness and good posability|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the  royal guard figure from the episode ii line actually works pretty well with its plastic cape but collectors have long wanted a version with cloth cape hasbro finally delivers the fabric used for the robes is a bit on the thick side but not so much so they drape nicely over the figures body and allow the helmet to rest comfortably on his head and shoulders even better if you remove the helmet and robes you get the main character from the crimson empire comics kir kanos i love how hasbro incorporated two separate characters into one figure not only does it give collectors an excuse to buy two of them but its also a neat way to get more expanded universe characters into the line|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|since i started collecting return of the jedi figures late november  i didnt get to preorder the last wave of the vintage collection  i really which i had started on  or a bit earlier  however i finally got this figure to get some measure of closure in my return of the jedi vintage collectionthis figure is from the vintage collection the emperors royal guard as seen in the film return of the jedi  with its red robe on this figure looks awesome very much like the original vintage royal guard but that is as far as i can tell without opening the packagein the bubble this figure wears a red fabric robe removable and a plastic red helmet removable and a baton crosses in front of the figure  this figure also include a vibro lance an additional red helmet a shoulder pad and a blaster pistolthis figure has balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hipsoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its been over  years since we got a nien nunb figure or at least nunb as he appeared in the cockpit of the falcon its actually pretty amazing since this guy is the one who saved the entire rebel fleet at endorregardless hasbro finally did nien nunb justice the figure comes with all the standard articulation weve come to expect from the vintage line what i really love about this figure though is the face hasbro did a great job giving it a more textured look with different shades of skin tones it looks a lot more realistic than the moviesnien nunb comes with a gun but i dont get why he also comes with a rifle it doesnt really fit in his hands for such an important figure i just wish hasbro could have given him something more appropriate maybe like a datapad|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember during the power of the force line being very impressed with hasbros take on prine face it was so good i didnt even think he needed much of an update over a dozen years later hasbro decided to revisit this character and did an even better job prune faces cloak sits on his head and shoulders perfectly like major panno he comes with a doublebarrel gun and comlink prune face also comes with his classic rifle although the tip seems to have gotten a bit bent in the packaging  nothing that cant be fixed though this figure is definitely a must for rotj fans|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|im trying to complete my return of the jedi collection from  years ago however prune face was one of those figure i missed the first time around and was not high in my list  that was until i read some bios in a star wars pedia  only then i started appreciate this character and by coincidence with an ultra sweet deal from amazon this character was almost impossible to passthis figure is from the vintage collection orrimaarko prune face as seen in the film return of the jedi this character is very well sculpted overall and is much better than the picture of it  however what really impressed me was its paint job  the use of shadows produces a perfect contrast to the point to make the characters clothes very realisticout of the box it comes wearing a cloak with pouches for a comm linksthis figure also include a blaster rifle a blaster pistol and a comm linkthis figure has a balljointed head ballhinged shoulders elbows torso knees and ankles and swivel wrists waist and hipsoverall this figure offers great likeness and posability|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|first  the accompanying photo is misleading  the mini spiral track is only the spiral piece to the left it does not include the piece of track extending far left the piece of track connecting the mini spiral track to the other playset nor does it include the playset to the right  update  there are  playsets in the takenplay line as of summer  and by putting a little aside each week grandpa  i have been able to collect all but four of them for our grandson so the fact that fisherprice has been coming out with some neat addon track options that enhance and expand our grandsons ability to be creative in his set arrangements has been terrific  first they came out with a bridge scurve and flexi track gave toysrus some great exclusives in a straight  curved track pack as well as a straight curved  crossings pack and now this mini spiral track as well as a bridge pack not to be confused with the first bridge  weve loved the rest but this mini spiral is a bit frustrating  its composed of  pieces of curved track which can connect into each other  not with the strength of a  year old we might add  to form a circle on the ground but what good is that with  support pieces of varying heights which you attach to the sides to create the spiral  first of all the shortest support piece has two holes so that you can increase or decrease the degree of the incline by only about an inch  a half but that is pointless because if you attach it at the highest hole the bottom of the track does not sit flush to the ground in order to connect it to additional track  additionally theres nothing to support the connection of additional track to the top of the spiral all of the track pieces we tried to connect to it disconnected right away when a train headed up or down unless we took one of the lightest trains in our grandsons fleet and gave it a very gentle push down how many  year olds do you know who give gentle pushes  the height is much shorter than wed bothered to look into prior to purchasing the top of the spiral is less than  off the ground  amazons  price is right at fisherprices summer  msrp for this item so we ordered it as soon as we saw it since it qualified for the free shipping  however this one does not appear very userfriendly  were guessing our grandson will come up with some way to use it but it could have been so much better if the good folks at fisherprice had just put their thinking caps on a little more snugly while designing itgrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  although recently weve seen a few signs that fp may be cheapening the line using more plastic instead of metal eliminating the chugging sounds of the talking engines as they move along the track etc well keep collecting them as long as he still shows an interest  hell be  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement with his little brother turning  in march it wont be long before hes playing with them too so were likely to be collecting for several years to come  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generationif youre interested in starting a collection of playsets they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds toteatrain playbox colin at the wharf thomas at the farm percys mail delivery knapford station rescue from misty island rock quarry run load  go tidmouth tunnel rumbling gold mine run toby at trotters farm sir handel at great waterton thomas at pirates cove the dieselworks sodor engine wash talking diesels fuel  freight delivery knapford holiday celebration the great quarry climb sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop sodor paint shop around the rails with thomas thomas treasure hunt adventure muddy adventure thomas at the ironworks go go speedy railway sodor lumber company thomas shark exhibit thomas adventure castle treasure tracks slate loading station paxton at the blue mountain stone shed a new version of the toteatrain playbox brendam docks lion canyon and arctic exhibit|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|maybe im being too picky but im just not impressed with the quality of this figure set its ok but there are some obvious quality control issuesfirst the paint application on the face and hands doesnt quite look like realistic flesh tones i tend to prefer plastic molded in flesh tones rather than painted flesh tones for comparison check out any of necas newer figures at the same price range to see how to really make lifelike figures you can even see where the black hair doesnt quite touch the ears making it look as if spock shaved the hair around his hairthere are a few other problems the set doesnt come with the horta eggs the horta isnt removable despite earlier assurances from diamond select that it was the base bottom is warped and not flush against a flat surfacewhen you finally set up spock on the base it still looks pretty cool you can overlook a lot of the small errors especially for this price range its a fun tribute to the original series its just that with a little more effort it could have been truly outstanding|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we build a lot of legos  we just finished jabbas palace and we were very happy to see that there was a building set for star trek that was similar you figure a good deal on a lego set is  cents a piece so this one at  cents has a very similar price we were hoping a nonlego branded set would have a more reasonable price and figured the star trek licensing wouldnt add to the items cost like star wars does butapparently notwe loved star trek into darkness so it was really fun to get this set right after seeing the moviepros the star trek figures are great you get kirk spock mccoy and  starfleet dudes i like it that they have holes in the back of their legs so that you can attach them to the chairs on the bridge they all came in separate bags as with legos the hair tends to fall off the blue lights with different options if you press more than once for blinking etc on the deflector dish and nacelles is a nice plus and obviously adds to the price  needs  aaa batteries the dish top comes off and you have a cool bridge with seats for all the characters including a captains chair a screen with a display of space that goes up and down and some other small details that are cool the tops of the nacelles are hinged and you can see nice detail of the mechanics underneath the full color instruction book was good there are normal sideview details but they add a topdown view that is handy easy to grasp the model because the entire lower section is one piece that means its more friendly to my  year old than other similar block models that dont withstand any play at all  honestly none of the lego or kreo are really suited for play with younger children unless you either glue them or dont mind them falling apart i think this is really for display or if youre like me its something nice to play with on your desk at work just watch everyones eyes get big when you pull off the top of the disc and show them the bridge that said this did hold together better than other ships weve made recentlypotential cons the four pieces that together comprise the circle that attaches the disc to the body do not go on well or stay on well because the parts they connect to are not rigid enough  when bent or pressed even a little it comes apart however we used brushon super glue just on those  pieces and it worked like a charm assembly is a little more difficult than a comparable sized lego because they dont do bag  bag  etcyou open all the bags and combine them together so a bit more of a challenge finding the parts then again more challenging can be fun though most of the bricks are fine these didnt fit together with the six sigmamachined smoothness and steadiness that legos doi think its great to have a brickstyle buildable enterprise and were very happy with this|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|when i was younger i read a book calledthe indian in the cupboardin which a magical cupboard could make toys come to life i was surprised to find out that neca also apparently has such a cupboard that can shrink real people down into action figures apparently somebody at neca captured arnold schwarzenegger dressed him up as he appeared in predator and forced him into the cupboard neca then put arnold in a little plastic bubble and shipped him to my houseyou can imagine my horror when i opened this box i thought i was getting an action figure based on the character dutch from predator i didnt think id actually get arnold himself i understand that some people might be upset at arnold because he had an affair and an illegitimate child however thats no reason to condemn the man to live the rest of his life as an action figure if i were a better person id try to find a way to free arnold but im not arnold happens to be just the right size for my neca predator figures so im keeping him on my shelfi noticed that neca cloned arnold and is now selling more of these as figures dont be fooled  this isnt an action figure its a miniaturized version of arnold himself if your conscience is not bothered by owning a real person shrunk down to  inches then by all means get this but be warned  every once in a while youll swear that arnolds beady eyes are looking at you in contempt as if hes about to say who the f are you|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember trying to find necas masked predator for years im glad i didnt get it because this  version is an incredible update from the previous one its a stunning work of artthe biggest update is the articulation the legs now have hip joints and doubleknees allowing you to stand him in more poses another very helpful update is that the shoulder cannon has a ball joint meaning it stays on well and moves very easily finally neca used a transcluscent plastic for the predators body which looks very much like sweaty flesh it looks great and makes for a nice contrast between the skin areas and the predators clothes and weaponsoverall i definitely recommend this for fans of the original predator movie its a fitting tribute|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|grandma  grandpa made an early christmas purchase the second we saw this  playset introduced in conjunction with s blue mountain mystery movie and making its first appearance on the  collector checklist on amazon at a penny below fisherprices january   msrp with free shipping  update  fisherprices summer  msrp was still   the good thing about being grandparents was we didnt have to wait until christmas to check it out wow  its so neat that it had us counting the days til christmas  another colorful addition to the takenplay line the track itself  and theres a lot of it  is a combination of an attractive shade of blue along with the typical greyishsilver features  inclines with a blue pivot wall at the bottom of the steepest incline and a blue rock support underneath the other curves and four points where it can be connected up to additional track or playsets  new character owen an enthusiastic traction engine and the rd nontrain character to be featured in a playset with cranky at the docks and colin at the wharf being the others is a light brown and is perched atop a grey and blue tower  the bright red drop saw tower has a bluewhite bmq blue mountain quarry sign at the top while the drop is a goldishorange with a silver saw  the tower base also includes a spinning goldishorange turntable and a grey loading zone and now for the action  when you give thomas included a nudge down the incline of blue track he passes over a lever that activates the spinning dropsaw  it drops down and cuts a slab of plastic bluestone which plops right into the cargo car brown plastic with  black wheels  both the rail car  cargo are also included  you bring thomas around the bend passing underneath the steep grey track incline and onto the turntable which is positioned underneath the blue track incline spinning it to allow thomas to back into the loading zone to connect up to his cargo car  thomas heads back onto the track via the turntable passes back underneath the steep incline around the bend and moving the pivot wall brings thomas to the base of the incline  you pull a cord located underneath the bay area connected to owen down fitting the metal cover at the end of the cord over thomass connecting magnet  you then hold down a lever located on owens back which allows owen to pull thomas and his cargo up the incline and into the bay  the detailing on these sets has always been great and this ones no exceptionoh my goodness our grandson was so thrilled with this set at christmas  as soon as we set it up he immediately brought winston sir topham hatts track inspection vehicle mr percival head of the narrow gauge railway in his little red car and all of his narrow gauge engines to live there  he likes to have homes for all of his engines so now  of his  narrow gauge engines are in their new digs skarloey  rheneas  sir handel  peter sam  rusty  fearless freddie  duke aka granpuff mighty mac  characters  mighty and mac  in one train and of course the newest member little luke   victor the only narrow gauge engine on sir topham hatts railway is the only exception  our grandson keeps him at the sodor steamworks repair shed with his sidekick kevin since thats where they workthe only thing id caution is that if you want a set your youngster can easily and quickly take on the road with you you might want to consider one of the   under msrp playsets instead  update  there are  tnp sets as of summer  that are what ive come to categorize as elaborate with msrps of   up and they are in order of introduction  rescue from misty island rock quarry run load  go rumbling gold mine run thomas at pirates cove the dieselworks the great quarry climb thomas at the ironworks thomas adventure castle slate loading station and lion canyon i wouldnt recommend them for easy transport  those are the only ones that grandma says have to stay put in the basement  theyre great if you plan to keep them set up at homegrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  unfortunately weve seen too many signs over the past year that fp is cheapening this line using more plastic instead of metal eliminating the chugging sounds of the talking engines as they move along the track etc so this will be the last year of our collection  our grandson turned  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement with his little brother now  months old it wont be long before hes playing with them too so were glad we made the investment while it was still a high quality line  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|this  pack stems from s king of the railway dvd and has percy pulling a yellow cargo car with a brown catapult with a brown boulder that our grandson will actually be able to launch and a blue cargo car with a light gray suit of armor that hes picked up from ulfstead castle  it looks pretty neat but keep in mind that with fisherprices msrp of  for this  pack youre paying  for percy and an extra  for a couple of plastic cars with plastic cargo  did one more amazon price check  as of  so they did finally come down before picking it up for  at walmart for our grandsons collection  howevergrandpa  i decided to make this the last year for the takenplay collection we started for our grandson the year it came out  and this  pack is a great example of why that decision was made  fp has really cheapened the line in our opinion especially over the past year  the trains and rail cars always used to be made of heavy feeling diecast metal but the trainsvehicles are now much lighter weight and the rail cars are now all plastic  this change to the lighter weight metal and heavy use of plastic came at the same time fp kept the msrp for the small enginesvehicles at  and actually raised the msrps of individually sold rolling stock ie cargo cars display cars from  to  almost a  increase  the  packs  when they were at their best qualitywise were always  now  over a  increase  small increases over the past few years if fp had maintained the quality is something we couldve accepted but the higher pricesdramatic quality reduction is a doublewhammy  and in this instance the sides of the cargo cars are so shallow that unless your youngster pushes percy gently along the track the cargo itself is going to flip out the suit of armor slides all over the place  we see amazon lowered this to  as of   maybe we wouldnt feel as ripped off if wed paid that  percy doesnt even have any special designing  it was a terrific ride while it lasted but definitely time to say amen to the collection after this yearwe really did have a lot of fun collecting all of the  packs with their various cargo cars  if youd be interested in starting your own collection there were  of them as of summer  and they are in order of introduction  percys sweet special thomas  the lion of sodor charlie  the aquarium thomas  the troublesome trucks henry  the gold mine harold  the search cars diesels spider delivery percys bumpy delivery rheneas new coat of paint sir handels day at the quarry gordons rattling cargo flynn to the rescue percys catapult and whiffs messy day  weve heard there will be a stephen  the treasure  pack this year as well  were still looking for a couple of more that were supposedly introduced in  but cant seem to find them  diesels engine repair and saltys diesel delivery  well purchase the remainder of the  takenplay products so that our grandson has a complete  year collection but thatll do it for us|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my kids are huge pokemon fanatics and begged me to buy some of the pokemon figures and the pokemon battle arena my eldest is  years old and he ripped it out of the box and claimed the pokemon he wanted while his sister screamed then i got it set up and turned it to  player quick mode so they could practice nice having the batteries in and ready  i had already watched the tomy pokemon battle arena videos on youtube so that i could explain everything to themto start they didnt understand how to select their pokemons type example fire water grass i showed them the attack tags for their selected pokemon and named some pokemon they knew well pikachu axew leavani to help them understand the different types i reminded them of some interesting battles they had seen like the episode where pikachu uses thundershock but it doesnt have any effect so i helped them select their types and we got started in quick mode which helps you practice for the real battlepound pound pound pound the kids hit their red buttons and pounded them as fast as they could you could see the led battle display showing the wave of attack  we then tried battle mode  fireworks  the kids were so excitedi gave them time to just pound it out then i tried to teach them to do the forwardattack backwarddefend movements they just werent very good at it  however i think an  year old would probably do fantastic with the real gameplay that the arena allowspros led display is colorful and draws in the kids attention can be either one player or two player has a practice mode and a battle modecons pokemon figures dont always stay in the attack base holder well younger kids struggle with real gameplay the videosads all talk about how knowledge of the pokemon types is important like the timing of the attacks and defenses but after all this time i just dont think that is really present in the current gameplay doesnt come with well known pokemon so if your kids are like mine youre going to be buying more  in fact full battle mode means  pokemon eachin summary my feeling is that the battle arena could have been just a little more straightforward but i think kids a little older than mine would have fun with it|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if youre looking to try out these new micro chargers this is a good place to start  this set comes with  car a couple of bits of track and the super dome oh and the charger is in there too of course  its a ton of fun for the boys  as stated in the title however for hours of play youll need to treat this as an addon set only to one of the larger track sets that micro chargers makes  by itself there really isnt much to it  dont buy it thinking youve bought that perfect gift for the recipient  you will definitely need to buy another set with track if this is the starter piece to this series  this is fun for awhile but it gets mundane just watching a car circling inside of the dome  so off the boys went with the cars you can buy cars separately which i strongly suggest doing to build their own race tracks for this thing out of legos of all things  that was certainly entertaining for all of us  also these sets dont appear to have an age limit  ages from  had fun with this setthis is one of those new toys that are just neat  the boys love them a ton and have had hours of play with these things even with this single set  since you can do about anything with legos they really saved the day with this set  im back for more  this is made to connect to the other micro charger sets so if youre considering this set be sure to think about adding another set for the track  unless of course youre innudated with legos  they can work on the matchbox sets however the tracks wont connect and youll have a gap trying to do so  they can use the cars by themselves for the matchbox and hot wheels sets but again this set wont attach to those tracks particularly since theyre about and inch to an inchandahalf smaller in width  highly highly recommend|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|for the most part the takenplay playsets have been terrific and we did an amazon price check one more time  as of  before heading to kmart to get one for our grandson at   under fisherprices  msrp  good deal we thought it looked pretty neat with  spiral tracks sprouting out from the left and the right of the top of the bright orange castle and has lots of neat features like a trip switch as thomas included descends that causes flags to unfurl and drops a treasure down  there are also knights that appear a drawbridge that lowers as well as a plastic troublesome truck with plastic removable gold treasure and eight places  in front  in back  on one of the sides to connect it up to other takenplay sets or additional track  you start by lifting the handle to set the engine gates set the two flags by flipping them up and latching them to the ramp set the cargo drop feature and place the treasure into position set the drawbridge by flipping it into the upright position and place thomas with his troublesome truck at opposite points at the tops of the two ramps behind the release gates  when you lower the handle its supposed to release thomas and the troublesome truck down the ramps as they roll down the track the treasure drops the flags flip down and they come together to knock down the drawbridge as the knights pop up  pretty clever  the treasure can be displayed on a platform which is supposed to lift up as the thomastroublesome truck pass  this is for age  but adult assembly is definitely requiredwell because troublesome truck is made of plastic instead of the diecast metal thomas is made of one of the big reasons this is the last year of the takenplay collection we started for our grandson in  heavy use of plastic now he is so light that when you lift the handle to release them only thomas descends most of the time  on the instances where troublesome truck does happen to descend and meets up with thomas sometimes they hook up sometimes they crash into each other but either way thomas ends up flipped over once he gets through the drawbridge  and the platform does not easily lift up as they pass you have to push thomas with a definite level of pressure before it will lift up  we werent sure whether to deduct one star or two because of this it does include a specially designed thomas with a castle crest and hes festooned with ribbons so we settled on a  star  the set is okay  our grandson plays with it and doesnt get as annoyed as we do that it doesnt work as described but when we compare this set to the elaborate sets of the past it just doesnt match up  we see amazon lowered it to  as of  maybe we wouldnt be as irritated as we are right now if wed paid that price definitely not worth its  msrpif you want a set your youngster can easily and quickly take on the road with you you might want to consider one of the   under msrp playsets instead  there were  tnp sets as of summer  that are what ive come to categorize as elaborate with msrps of   up and they are in order of introduction  rescue from misty island rock quarry run load  go rumbling gold mine run thomas at pirates cove the dieselworks the great quarry climb thomas at the ironworks thomas adventure castle slate loading station and lion canyon i wouldnt recommend them for easy transport  those are the only ones that grandma says have to stay put in the basement  most of them are great if you plan to keep them set up at home|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|stephen is one of the new characters introduced in s king of the railway dvd  hes also referred to as rocket thats because hes based on the reallife stephensons rocket the famous train who  in   began the steam age of trains  even though hes a little slower and maybe not as strong as his newer friends no one can top his positive spirit and knowledge  he has his own coaches like thomas  grandpa  i snatched this little guy up when we saw him on amazon for  with free shipping right at fisherprices msrp of  to avoid the christmas rushgrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    at the time it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  he turned  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement his little brother is  months old and it wont be long before hes playing with them too  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation  unfortunately the line in general has gone downhill over the past year so this will be the last year of the collection  at least our younger grandchild will have the first few years of the collection to play with before fisherprice started cutting corners|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|im not quite sure whom this doll is for i bought it for my niece who loves arial both are redheads as other reviewers have noted the design of the doll is beautiful arial has a very pretty face and a charming aesthetic the dress is very detailed with some embroidery on the front and sparkles throughout i also noticed the neck arm and wrist joints are well hiddenbut there are some parts of the doll that make me think this is for collectors and some that make me think shes for kids the price is actually not all that high for a barbielike doll however as others have noted the legs are stiff and made of cheap plastic this means ariel cant really sit or drive a car not sure why youd want her to but some kids might try the dress isnt stiff but one also has to wonder how durable it isat the end of the day the little charm bracelet makes it clear the primary market is for kids however id recommend treating this doll better than most keep her in the box when the kids arent playing with her id say the ideal market for this doll is a combination of a little girl who wants to play with ariel and an adult who appreciates disney princesses|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|overall reviewthe newest dream townhouse improves on the previous  story dreamhouse in quite a few smart ways  moving the elevator to the center gives a nice focal point and makes all the rooms a bit more accessible  gone is the deckhottub and in its place is a great walk in closet for keeping barbies fashions and accessories the layout is better as well  less unused floor space and situating the furniture against the back wall instead of all over  it makes it easier to use the rooms furniture  i especially liked the pegs on the countertop that allow all the little accessories to click in and not fall over or get lost  thats a vast improvement over the previous deramhouseas with all dreamhouses the following issues still apply  you will get assembly instructions with pictures that make it hard to figure out what to do electronics doorbells flushing toilet etc will all need to be tested before assembly to make sure the house is fully working mattel barbie toys have a poor track record for working accessories sadly the elvators never work smoothly  i had high hopes for this one but sadly the same problem persists youd think itd be solved in  years and the elevator catches on floors and gets stuck  in fact we gave up on the elevator all together in last years dreamhouse modeldeciding on a new home for barbiethe townhouse malibu dreamhouse beach house glam vacation house pink world house fashion fairytale palace lightup castle etc all offer something different for barbie in particular the townhouse is a much better deal when compared to the malibu dreamhouse  for about  more barbie gets an elevator a lot more furniture and a house that takes up more wall space than floor space as well the townhouse suits barbie scale much better than the malibu dreamhouse which can feel a bit crowded the glam vacation house and pink world house dont have much in the way of ceilings or floors mostly just walls so girls dont really feel like they have a house my  year old never really liked the pink house  it took up too much room in her floor and since it didnt have much of a floor furniture fell over constantly on carpet as for the fairytale dvd movie houses they are built specifically for a character and regular barbies may seemfeel very out of place the dream townhouse gives plenty of roominess for a variety of the more inexpensive barbies such as the fashionistas whose articulated arms and legs go well with the townhouseif you are deciding on whether to get the old or the new dreamhouse the old dreamhouse is heavily discounted id suggest spending the extra money for the new version  the improvements really make this far more usable and a better experienceassembling the dream townhouseas noted above install batteries and check all electronics before assembling mattel does have an assembly video that you can access as well   version dream townhouse to get an idea of how to put it together but honestly it wasnt that hard mattel has been smart and designed it such that you match up shapes to pieces and pieces all come in different widths so they wont snap into the wrong place this was the same case with the monster high school playset and made sure that you assembled once and were done ikea has also gone this route thankfully assembly ideally takes  minutes at most including taking out of the package the graphics are setalready there thankfully so no annoying stickers to put togetherdurabilitythe houses of the past tended to be put together in roomsized pieces and so broke down fairly easily due to lack of a solid base the newer dreamhouses comes with one solid wall piece with folding permanently attached floors this gives some durability to the house once the floors are dropped it is held together by the thick columns on each level the top level then fits onto the second floor top the elevator has a track and fortunately the new design means that sagging parts dont cause it to fall out as easily  though the rickety plastics used inevitably mean the elevator sticks the newer plastics also seem to contribute to the variations in track sizes for the elevators  often requiring a bit of modification if your elevator doesnt work well or as designed but that said this is much better quality than the previous dream townhouseaestheticsits great to see barbie adding in more colors than pink or white though there was an odd yellow fold out house in the s this townhouse has blue flooring in the middle and there are some purples thrown in for variety plus many shades of pinks  dark to light  add interest note that the color isnt as saturated as in the images on amazon so it isnt as eye wincingly bright the house is a good scale for barbie and the dolls dont feel crowded though ken might be a bit tall for the middle level as well it makes a beautiful display for barbies when not in playalternativesthe barbie dream house is the top of the line barbie house and is priced accordingly keep in mind that there are other alternatives if you dont wantneed the barbie branding or would like a house not made of plastic kidcraft has an excellent line of full wood with full color graphics doll houses that are priced comparably to this house those doll houses are also barbiescale and ideal for a larger doll collection that may include moxie bratz etcsummaryin all this is an improvement and provides more value for money than the other barbie houses quality variation issues keep this from being a  star product as well as the hefty price  the elevator doesnt always work well and the electronics especially may not all work|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my eightyearold daughter has been a polly pocket fan for several years now so she was super excited to receive this playset the set up out of the box was really easy and i think this playset makes for a great summer toy the little boat can be attached to the rest of the yacht and looks like one big yacht but it can also be opened up to reveal a sort of island retreat with two attached plastic palm trees and several accessories such as a deck chair a bbq grill that flips a beach umbrella and little fashion accessories for the one blondehaired polly doll that comes with this set if you have a polly fan at home that has other polly playsets the dolls can be used to buddy up with this polly doll we actually managed to find a couple of dolls other deck chairs and beach umbrellas from other summerthemed playsets so that polly and friends could throw a great beach partytheres another bonus to this playset  the smaller speedboat can be easily detached from the front of the yacht and when you push the little button polly will perform some cool water ski flips it is a fun playset perfect for the summer note there are some tiny accessories that come with this playset so i would recommend it for ages  and up as the smaller items could pose a choking hazard|spam
A1Z54EM24Y40LL|if you do nothing else but buy this doll to put in a curio cabinet then youve done well  it is definitely one of the most beautiful barbie dolls ive ever seen  her wings are just gorgeous  fuschia and black mixed with glitter is so gorgeous  shes functional too  the wings make up her ball gown and when shes ready to fly zip then the gown turns into wings  just lots of oohs and ahhs at this house and the girls just love her  she is a wonderful complement to the dvd too  just an added thing to bring the movie to lifeone suggestion however  since shes quite gorgeous i would even at this price recommend that you buy one for play and buy a second to put away to save  unless extreme care is taken with the doll i dont think the wings would continue to function say  years from now with excessive play  also here in ohio this is a great price here on amazon  shes over thirty dollars at the stores here  other than that highly recommend|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|having a carstoons installment air mater and its resulting products cars take flight introduce a place called propwash junction the hometown of the main character in disneys new planes movie was really a clever idea  just as the cars town of radiator springs had its neat characters so does propwash junction  the planes protagonist is a single prop cropduster named dusty crophopper and leadbottom is a biplane whos dustys boss and the proprieter of the vitaminamulch that dusty sprays on the crops  he thinks dustys dreams of flying in the wings around the world race are silly  hes a cool looking plane with his yellow wings and tail and signs advertising vitaminamulch on the sides of his gray body hes given a voice in the movie by cedric the entertainer  we knew once our grandson heard about the planes spinoff hed be thrilled if we started a collection of these guys to visit with all of his cars diecasts  so we wrapped up the dvd along with as many of the characters we could find this past christmas and he immediately took off into the wild blue yonder  we got leadbottom as part of a neat target  pack called  of course  propwash junction which also included dusty chug dustys good friend and skipper riley dustys mentor  we liked both the price  with mattels msrp being  a piece and the fact that it saved the time of hunting for four items separatelywe knew going into it that we wanted the  scale mattel versions instead of disney stores  scale models  wed used up way too much super glue on the disney store models of cars we bought  even though they looked cool and were much weightier than mattels pieces would continually break off and it got frustrating for our grandson and annoying for us  durability is the name of the game and so far all of the wheels and propellers are going strong  our plan is to box them up when he outgrows them and pull them out of the attic when he has kids of his own|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W| but you should probably check it out before ordering since the model  for the original was cbm and for the fire  rescue version is cbn  this listing says the model  is x which is neither of them  but since it looks like the fire  rescue version thats what ill reviewwe figured chug would have to return in the planes sequel  hes a fuel truck who is dustys good friend and biggest supporter similar to lightning mcqueen and mater in the cars town of radiator springs  his mentor skipper and boss leadbottom also return so i was trying to determine if there were enough differences in the diecasts from the separate movies to warrant a purchase of a second version of each  as far as chug goes the differences i see are he has silver bumpers with rust versus the brown bumpers of the first version the far right  left lights on his cab roof protrude upward versus not protruding on the first version looks like a lot more rust or dirt perhaps on his doors and fenders and it appears his hubcaps are silver versus brown on the first version  hmm decisions decisions  ill figure that out while im waiting for the price to come down toys r us is selling a bunch of these mattel  scale fire  rescue figures for  as of  which is right at the  msrp  amazons free shipping price is much higher as of the same date but well be holding onto them as christmas gifts so ive got plenty of time  in the meantime our  year old grandson is beside himself with excitement about going to see the sequel with us on april th and meeting all of the new characters who work together putting out wildfires at piston peakthe mattel diecast collections cars  and the original planes have just been such a great investment for us with two grandsons already and another due to arrive in september  the feel is more of an extremely sturdy plastic rather than metal but weve found thats exactly what makes them stand up to rougher play than the disney stores larger  scale models  their handsome display cases is probably where they ought to stay the much heavier metal concentration means the small pieces are more brittle and break off so easily  weve really been pleased with the level of durability and the planes models have lived in our home for  months with all propellers and wheels still intact despite more nosedives than we can begin to count  would love to see them end up in the hands of our great grandkids someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our grandson has thoroughly enjoyed all of his cars diecasts which led us to beginning a planes collection for him this past christmas  the air mater episode of carstoons was a good leadin to planes and we gave him the dvd along with as many of the characters from the movie that we could find  ned is one of the rather dimwitted cohorts of ripslinger dusty cropdusters arch rival in the movie who works with his buddy zed to try to sabotage poor dusty  you can tell ned by his white wings with the number  on his left wing and tail but even better for easily confused grandparents his name is on his tail as well  our grandsons very happily playing with his new guys  gals  we actually purchased his ned  along with ripslinger zed and a supercharged version of dusty in a nice  pack that target had for  called air ambush which we thought was a decent price given mattels  msrp for each of themdidnt have to wonder whether to buy disney stores  scale models or these  our experience with disney store cars items wasnt too good theyre larger than mattels  scale and are made of a heavier metal  but thats exactly why they dont withstand any heavy duty racing  so many pieces were breaking off that we had to buy stock in super glue  we feel the mattel versions which to us feel more like a very sturdy plastic than diecast metal are much more durable  so far all wheels  propellers are intact  should hold up well enough for him to be able to share playtime with his own kids one day|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|weve derived so much pleasure in watching our grandsons enjoyment of his cars collection so as soon as he got wind of the planes spinoff we made up our minds immediately what collection wed begin next  excited isnt a good enough word to describe the way his eyes lit up when he opened his christmas gifts of the planes dvd accompanied by as many of the characters as we were able to find  hes been having the time of his life  ishani is racer  the exotic panasian champion from india is main character dusty crophoppers love interest in the movie and she is dropdead gorgeous  we hear shes modeled after an aerocad aerocanard and her redyellow paint is striking  although you cant mistake ishani we like it that her name is delicately painted right next to her   her characters voice is done by priyanka chopra s miss world no less  we happened across ishani as part of a nice target  pack called wings around the globe containing some of dustys primary competitors it also included ripslinger el chupacabra and bulldog  what a relief not to have to look all over the place for each one individually and the price was right  so it was right at mattels  msrp for eachwe knew from experience with mattels versions of the cars compared to disney stores versions that mattels  planes models were the right ones for us  though disney stores cars and planes are very neat looking larger  scale and made with a heavier diecast metal compared to the feel of a very sturdy plastic that we think the mattel models have we always had trouble with pieces breaking off which was very frustrating  durability is the name of the game for us since were hoping well be able to box up his collections and save them for sometime in the future when he can reintroduce them to his own kids|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our grandson had really been looking forward to the planes movie having had so much fun racing on the ground with all of his cars guys  hes enjoyed all of the carstoons episodes as well with air mater being the episode that was the transition from cars to planes which we thought was pretty clever  we wrapped up the dvd as well as the available characters from it this past christmas and hes been having a blast  zed along with ned are the dimwitted henchmen of dusty crophoppers arch rival in the movie ripslinger and they all try to make things very difficult for the hero  zed is the one with the green wings with  on his left wing and tail but the best thing for grandparents like us who get confused is that his name is on his tail as well  we were able to find all three  along with a supercharged version of dusty  in a convenient and reasonably priced  target  pack called air ambush a fair price with mattels  msrp for each of them which also saved us the trouble of tracking each one down separatelyhaving already had some experience with the disney stores  scale models of cars  feeling that despite their being larger than mattels  scale and constructed of a heavier metal they werent nearly as durable as his mattel versions  we already knew wed want the mattel diecasts this time though we think they feel more like a very sturdy plastic than diecast metal  no breaking of wheels or propellers yet and considering the competitiveness of our grandsons races thats pretty amazing  bet theyll still be around when he has kids of his own|spam

A1Z54EM24Y40LL|we previously purchased just the bow and arrows that come with this set and to tell the truth the bow just doesnt hold up very long before the strings break  the target on this set is quite flimsy cardboard stuff and although it is holding up quite well at the moment i really dont expect it to last more than one summer based on this companys previous products that weve purchased  those arrows shoot hard too really really hard so be sure to have parental supervision with this item since it could seriously hurt a child if it struck someone in the head in particular  you really wouldnt believe how loud the bang is once these arrows strike a target  scares our cat half to deathother than that it is a very fun toy not for use in the house around delicate items but makes a great basement toy in the winter too  i do recommend this toy however with the above precautions  i wouldnt buy this toy for a household with children less than  years of age|spam

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my yearold daughter loves collecting little figurines and dolls and has always been fascinated with miniatures rather than those largesized dolls so it wasnt a surprise when i saw her admiring these kawaii crush playset i got her several sets but the series isnt wideranging and im not sure if the company manufacturing these sets intends on expanding the range in the meantime though my daughter is having fun playing with themthe doll that comes with this set is named mandy candy dot dot and my daughter decided to rename it cos she wasnt taken with the original name  the doll is cute with long tangerine colored hair that is made of this rubbery plastic material that feels pleasant to the touch my daughter prefers the rubberplastic hair rather than nylon hair because the latter is hard to maintain there are many cute accessories that come with this set such as a cute hat and lots of other tiny toys so i would not recommend this toy to children under three as they may pose a choking hazard|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the equestria girls dolls come in two version  deluxe and normal  the normal dolls do not have articulation and their handslegs dont bend  they wear the outfits that the girls wore through much of the movie  the deluxe versions however are much more posable and wear outfits from the dance at the end of the movie  my  year old liked the deluxe versions more because they can sit better and had more hairthe dolls are about bratz sized  and like the bratz dolls the shoes pop off at the ankle and there are no feet  each doll has a slot at the back where wings can be attached though not all dolls come with wings  they all have the same mold though painted differently and with different hairthe dolls can pretty much stand on their own  so they make great displays when not in playnote that the hair does get ratty easy in the back and thats why i rate this  out of  stars|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my preschooler had already used some magformers at school so when we opened the amazon box he was crazy excited to get his own set he immediately set to work recreating the diamond solitaire that is on the box cover  he then took the lighted piece there is only one and it was precharged flipped the switch on and put it into the diamond  it lights up the object nicely though not as bright as it looks in the picture unless you have the lights offthere are so many different pieces and i had as much fun as my  year old and  year old putting things together no matter which way you bring them together they come together and hold nicely  it is one of the most innovative and fun toys that my children have ever played withthere are some new pieces we havent seen in magformers sets before they are a bit rounded so that you can make for example an ice cream cone  it does feel like the possibilities are endless  i loved the clear pyramidcapped piecesthe magformers price is high and when you open the box and see how many pieces you have you feel it but i thought it was so worth it that i bought a second set for the kidsthe pieces feel very durable with soft transparent colored rubber coating  the light can be charged via the included usb cable and has an onoff switch  it snaps into certain square pieceslove it|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i was undecided for the longest time but i finally got my r unit from amazon  i think this is one you may want to see live first before you buy but im glad i didnt wait any longerthis is rd from the black series  line as seen on  well every episode of star wars i to vithe articulation of this figure is as standard for many such astromech droid figures rotating dome swivel legs and hinged ankles extending third leg controlled by dome rotation andthis figure have plenty of features that i like  the front vertical panel open to reveal its utility arms the dome compartments can be removed to plugin the sensor attachments or hold luke skywalker lightsaber hilt and swappable deployed rocket boosters panels on the side of the legs  so you can have an r for every almost every scene on the movieshowever there is room for improvement  i thought that the size of r would bother me as it is a commonly known issue but that is not the case  apparently r is supposed to be almost a meter tall and this figure is   tall which using    converts to  and  tall almost a meterthe thing that really bothers me of this figure is that this r unit is too clean  r would only be clean in ceremonies if any  however how can you put a dirt wash on this figure and still remain universal to all the movies  i dont know how and neither did hasbrofinally there is the issue with the extensible third leg being controlled with the rotating dome  not a bad idea but i think that r ends up with a leg way too extended while facing forwardin all this is a great figure with sufficient gadgets to pose rd for most scenes of the star wars movies|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to like about this version of fett the sculpt is phenomenal and the articulation allows you to place him in a variety of poses unfortunately the paint gets a bit sloppy something ive noticed on a lot of the  figures on mine there was a large wallop of silvery paint on the black glass of fetts helmet i painted over it myself with glossy black paint but its still something that should never have gotten past quality control id warn buyers to try to find this figure in a retail store first and inspect him carefully in order to get a good sample aside from that hassle its a great figure|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i was not looking forward to collect  figure until i saw the pictures of the sandtrooper of course boba fett was the character that started this madness and i had to have it too this seems to be basically the same sdcc figure repackaged for us mortalsthis is boba fett is from the black series  line as seen in empire strike backthe articulation of this figure is short of awesome surpassing the best from the vintage collection balljoined head ballhinged shoulders swivel right biceps ballhinged elbows ballhinged wrists balljoined torso ballhinged hips swivel thighs frontback hinged higher and lower knees and ballhinged anklesthis is another armored figure that hides the articulation as much as possible you still can see the pegs on the ballhinges elbows and hinged knees and the ballhinges on the shoulders and hips are well hidden by armor and pouches however the swivel on the bicep is perceptible even as the cable that connect the forearm controller to the bicep just before the swivel is a nice touch unfortunately the pouches hanging from the front of its belt are hard plastic and limits the freedom of moment of the hips the belt could be rotated around the waist to free the hips as it is an unremovable accessory but looks odd that wayhowever the way the ballhinged ankles work is ingenious the foot angles frontback but swivels inwardsoutwards so if you stretch the legs swiveling the feet inward would allow the sole of shoes to be parallel to the ground this makes the figure very stable even in action poses in addition the figure can angle the wrist inwardoutward specially valuable when trying to pose the figure holding the blaster shotgun and blaster pistolon top of a great sculpt and articulation this figure has an amazing paint job the wear and tear on the green of the armor is awesome down to detailed dent and nicks the gray uniform has subtle dirt wash specially perceptible towards the legs compared to the vintage collection counterpart i think this figure looks bettera few accessories has been included to complement an already awesome figure besides its pistol which fit well into its holster from the belt the figure include a light repeating blaster rifle and its trademark jet pack which the figure balances well when attached to it as with the sdcc version this one doesnt include a removable helmet and the eye sight doesnt swing forward eitherthis figure may still have the same faults as from sdcc but im too distracted with the good in its sculpt paint and articulation to noticein all this is a great figure with guns and back pack for posing for those scenes in empire strike back|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|leia is definitely the weakest figure in wave  of the star wars  line but that doesnt mean shes a bad figure on my figure the face paint is cleanly applied and the plastic skin looks realistic its actually not a bad likeness of carrie fisher for me the biggest problem is the glaring knee joints which undermine the sculpt if you can get her on sale shes definitely a worthwhile addition to your collection|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|princess leia on slave outfit is a good figure to buy but only if you see it first on this premium line and price you need to be somewhat forgiving of its faults to buy itthis princes leia is from the black series  line as seen at the beginning of the return of the jedithe articulation of this figure is short of awesome surpassing the previous attempt from the vintage collection balljoined head ballhinged shoulders swivel right biceps ballhinged elbows ballhinged wrists balljoined torso ballhinged hips swivel thighs frontback hinged higher and lower knees and ballhinged ankleslets start with the good this is the first figure from the return of the jedi movie the sculpt and paint are good overall sans a few faults that almost kill it for collectors her hair is well detailed and the braid over her right shoulder is rubbery and doesnt interfere with the head movement as much the tone of her skin is good and on her sculpted clothing including boots are really well done she even sports a fabric loin clothskirt which is the best representation on any line so far at a distance and already on display pose princess leia looks really goodon a close up is where this figure falls apart the first issue you notice right away is her bland stare her expression is plain devoid of emotion and makes any action pose look fake in a close up in my opinion the paint job of her eyes actually takes away from her likeness to carrie fisher the second issue i found with this figure is her feet these do not swivel inwardsoutwards like most previous figures rd excepted which makes her standing action poses a bit unstable the third and last issue is her hips these are too wide for princess leia but on an action pose the wideness of her hips become less noticeablethis figure included on two different skiff pikes if hasbro had thrown a few other accessories like those included for the sandstorm version vc in the vintage collection it would have helped this figure the poncho and googles would have come very handy even better i have heard suggested a swappable head with a different expressionin all this figure is average but im still satisfied with it this was a very difficult figure to pull off well on a starting line like this one an admirable attempt for hasbro which barely made it i wished that hasbro had done better so i could feel at ease with the future of this line|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ive been skeptical of the  line of figures especially the humans with painted skin however i think hasbro really stepped up its game with this han solo this figure came out wonderfully the paint job frequently sloppy on the  line looks pretty good its not perfect and youll probably want to inspect a few in retail stores to choose the best but there are relatively few quality control issues hasbro also provided us with generous accessories including an extra set of gloved hands and two belts and two guns its nice to have customization options overall this could easily become my favorite of the  line thus far|spam
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this version of han solo fares better than expected paired with a good set of accessories it is almost a wining figure to owns sans the limited likeness to harrison fordthis han solo is from the black series  line as seen in a new hopethe overall sculpt and paint of this figure is really good with details such as the folds and creases on the clothing really well done  however it seems that hasbro is having issues with getting the likeness right on figures like han and princess leia again it is the face that almost fails this figure there is some likeness with harrison ford but only when looking at it at certain angles so as long as you are not looking too close this is a good figure to pose and admirethe articulation of this figure is as awesome as other figures in the black series  line and an expected standard fore these balljoined head ballhinged shoulders swivel right biceps ballhinged elbows ballhinged wrists balljoined torso ballhinged hips swivel thighs frontback hinged higher and lower knees and ballhinged anklesthe articulation is as good as previous in figures such as the sandtrooper however it is more difficult to hide articulation in this figure specially on the hips yet the shoulders benefit of a well molded vest which is its own separate piece interestingly enough the double jointedness of the knees are not as obvious as i thought it would bethis figure includes two blasters han solos own and a stormtroopers likewise it also includes two belts with holsters han solos and stormtroopers and a pair of swappable hands with sculpted glovesin all this figure suffer a bit in likeness but it is otherwise satisfying this is yet an admirable first attempt on han solo by hasbro|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|unlike other reviewers i have this figure already i love the idea of a  stormtrooper but i was very disappointed with it hasbro clearly just recycled the body of the excellent  sandtrooper figure this means that its neck is too long the sandtrooper had a longer neck because its helmet sat on top of a pauldron however on the stormtrooper it just makes him look like a giraffe the helmet should sit much closer to the figures torso for such an expensive figure id at least have hoped hasbro would gotten the basics right as it stands id pass on buying this figure until hasbro fixes this mistake|ham
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|the stormtrooper follows the successful steps of its predecessor for a sure hit on hasbros black series  line up  the only short comings on this figure are the lack of accessories when compared to the sandtrooper and that lack of this figure at any store at least for now may  this stormtrooper is from the black series  line as seen on a new hope empire strike back and return of the jedithe articulation of this figure is short of awesome following the sandtroopers proven formula balljoined head frontback hinged neck ballhinged shoulders swivel biceps ballhinged elbows ballhinged wrists balljoined torso ballhinged hips swivel thighs frontback hinged higher and lower knees and ballhinged ankleshasbros modelers had taken full advantage of this armored figure to hide the articulation as much as possible unfortunately the armor limits the freedom of moment on those parts as well  however the foot angles frontback but swivels inwardsoutwards for great stability in action poses in addition the figure can angle the wrist inwardoutward for posing the figure holding its blaster rifle with both handsalthough the sculpt on the stormtrooper is obviously based on the sandtrooper there are a few differences the sculpt of buttons on the abdomen panel and the left knee to name the only two i could spotthis time around this figure has clean white paint job with some distinctions from the sandtrooper  the black line on the eyebrows is a bit wider the black on the chin does not cover fully and the pouches at the side of the belt are white insteadhowever there are not as many accessories to complement the stormtrooper besides its blaster pistol the figure just include a blaster rifle different from the sandtroopersbottom line this figure sports the good sculpt paint and articulation from its predecessor  army builders love this figure judging how hard it was to get just one  the drop of half a star must round down it just that i like the sandtrooper better because it has more personality and accessoriesin all this is a good figure with some weapons to use for posing for those scenes in the original star wars trilogy|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to like about this figure the body sculpt is spot on but the face doesnt capture mark hamils likeness the biggest problem is that its just too long also the paint application on some of the figures really misses the mark including paint that doesnt even cover the eyes correctly id really recommend against getting this online without inspecting it in a store first|ham
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this is the second version of luke skywalker in the black series  i take this bespin luke as an interim version since the likeness to mark hamill is better than with pilot luke but not quite there yet  yes i hope that hasbro gets it done right with jedi lukethis luke skywalker is from the black series  line as seen in empire strike backthe overall sculpt and paint of this figure is good  this version has better likeness to mark hamill than the previous  he seems to be looking a bit to the left which is good fonly for a pose with the lightsaber but his face is otherwise neutral  interestingly his hair now better matches his jumpsuit  in my opinion hasbro has a better record when the figure wears a helmet  however other details are very well sculpted such as folds and creases on the jumpsuitthe articulation of this figure is as awesome as other figures in the black series  line and an expected standard for these balljoined head ballhinged shoulders swivel right biceps ballhinged elbows ballhinged wrists sideside swivel balljoined torso ballhinged hips swivel thighs frontback hinged higher and lower knees and ballhinged anklesthere are some limitations on the shoulders but none on the hips where the articulation is not very well hidden  the double jointedness of the knees are a bit obvious too but these issues can not be helped  one nice thing is that both wrists swivel side to side which is good for a lightsaber wielding characterthis figure includes one blasters and a lightsaber but nothing elsein all this figure suffer a bit in likeness just like han solo but it is otherwise satisfying this is yet another admirable attempt by hasbro|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure might be controversial as the prequel films arent really the favorite of most collectors but i for one am glad we got a prequel era jedi in the line its a pretty simple figure but generally works the jedi outfit is sculpted with nice texture simulating the feel of clothhowever this figure gets knocked down several stars because of what its missing first theres no robe the brown robes were an essential part of the jedi garb note you can buy custom robes on ebay for a reasonable price but hasbro should have included one for the price its charging second the arm articulation is pretty limited especially at the elbow joints to the point where its very difficult to get the figure to hold his lightsaber with two hands finally the paint application on the face on some samples is very sloppy  be sure to inspect the figures before you buy themtheres a lot i like about this figure and im glad i got him but im frustrated that hasbro is charging so much for this line and not delivering the goods id recommend waiting until the figure goes on sale before getting him|ham
A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|this obi wan is from the black series  line as seen in revenge of the siththe overall sculpt and paint of this figure is good  this version has a good likeness to  ewan mcgregor but the look in his face is too neutral  however other details are very well sculpted such as folds and creases on the tunic  this figure also includes fabric from the waist down but unlike previous version in the   line this time the fabric matches the tunic very wellthe articulation of this figure is as awesome as other figures in the black series  line and an expected standard for these balljoined head ballhinged shoulders swivel right biceps ballhinged elbows ballhinged wrists frontback swivel balljoined torso ballhinged hips swivel thighs frontback hinged higher and lower knees and ballhinged anklesthere are some limitations on the shoulders because of the tunic but none on the hips the articulation on the shoulders and elbows is visible but the ones on the his is very well hidden by the fabric tunic  the double jointedness of the knees are not as obvious as in other nonarmored characters probably because the high boots and pants are close to the figures contours unlike luke obiwan wrists swivel front to back  this means that he can not point with his lightsaberthis figure includes a lightsaber but thats it  this figure would benefit with some accessories like a jedi cloak  or an additional head or two with different expressions  that would bump these figure a star in my bookthis figure may have come a bit early in this line as the only villain i could fetch to oppose him was darth maul im thinking off a their encounters in clone wars albeit with different outfits or legs in the case of darth maulin all this figure has the best likeness for a nonhelmeted human character so far just because luke han and leia are off  however the neutrality on the face of these figures is a bit of discouraging  regardless this is yet another admirable attempt by hasbro|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|id been skeptical of hasbros  line but this greedo figure shows the lines true potential its got all of the great articulation weve come to expect from the  line what really struck me is the weathering and detail in the pain applications greedos outfit looks appropriately grungy and used its the type of detail hasbro cant possibly fit in the   line definitely one of the highlights of the line thus far|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|when i was younger i read a book called the indian in the cupboard in which a magical cupboard could make toys come to life i was surprised to find out that neca also apparently has such a cupboard that can shrink real people down into action figures apparently somebody at neca captured arnold schwarzenegger dressed him up as he appeared in predator and forced him into the cupboard neca then put arnold in a little plastic bubble and shipped him to my houseyou can imagine my horror when i opened this box i thought i was getting an action figure based on the character dutch from predator i didnt think id actually get arnold himself i understand that some people might be upset at arnold because he had an affair and an illegitimate child however thats no reason to condemn the man to live the rest of his life as an action figure if i were a better person id try to find a way to free arnold but im not arnold happens to be just the right size for my neca predator figures so im keeping him on my shelfi noticed that neca cloned arnold and is now selling more of these as figures dont be fooled  this isnt an action figure its a miniaturized version of arnold himself if your conscience is not bothered by owning a real person shrunk down to  inches then by all means get this but be warned  every once in a while youll swear that arnolds beady eyes are looking at you in contempt as if hes about to say who the f are you|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|thief is the latest iteration of the first person actionsneak series  this version is mostly in first person with a few climbing scenes presented in third person perspective  it takes advantage of the latest in graphic but not the latest modeling techniques  it also struggles in the department that was the staple of this series sound effects and voice acting  once you get past all caviats the game is enjoyable but you may want to wait for the price to drop a lot before you buyfirst impressions february  thief looks gorgeous with shinning queues here and there making use of todays graphic power  this game even uses touch for your thieving activities in the form of a rumble in your game pad  however no game can be called thief unless it uses sounds to its most advantage and this one is not to be left behind when it worksim a long time fan of the thief franchise  i had played previous incarnation of thief on pcs so this is my first time ever playing a game called thief on the ps  i cannot deny that i have high expectations for this game but i want it to make a triumphant return  so i was a bit disappointed when the sound completely cut off after playing the introduction for a minute or two  ok i was totally annoyed suffice to say my jaw dropped and i have to restrain an urge to throw my game pad at my tv  however after a quick restart i was able to play through the introduction  and i can say that i was satisfied that this is a thief game i want to enjoybefore you get to the introduction you will encounter the first choice in what mode you want to play this game  it comes in three levels rogue easy thief medium and hard master  it also has a custom mode to tailor your game experience  i choose thief because i expect it to yield the experience that the game developer intended to deliver  however master offers the most restrictive mode as even knocking down civilians is prohibitedin the introduction garrett is doing what he does best stealing  the objects that you want to pay attention to shine on the open but as a good thief you may want to search every box drawer or cabinet in a room  as you move on youll learn how to use your game pad for leaping l crouching  left thumbstick hat l observing right thumbstick hat r shooting a rope arrow r and so on  the introduction also let you listen to conversations at the turn of a corner to which you can lean around to see hug the wall click square and lean with the left thumbstick and even feel rumble hidden triggers as you search or as you move your lock picking instrumentstowards the end of the tutorial i found my first surprise as the ingame cut scene let you see garrett very well and he looks  like a not very impressive thief  but the question is is this master thief garrett from the previous games or a rebootthe first chapter seemed to be a continuation of the tutorial at first adding new elements like using water arrows and knock downs  but towards the end i encounter another ingame cinematic that made me gasp in awe  it propels the main story of this game and immediately made me want to know more  im hooked line and sinker and to answer the question i made earlier this game seems to be a continuation to master garrett adventureshowever there are some disappointing issues besides the glitch  for one the game mechanics are not as free as in the original games  for example to look arround the corner you have to hug the wall first click square next to a wall then you can lean a bit with the left thumbstick  also i have not found out a way to run away without using the x button for a quick swoop  i know i should not get caught in the first placeanother is that the character moodels are not as sharp as those found in recent games like tomb raiders but they are leaps and bounds from the original series i also feel that the textures could be better but that is because im using a ps  if you are a fan of thief this game will make you wish you had a pshowever the most disappointing part so far is the portrayal of garrett  im aware that garrett is not batman but it should not be so far behind  however this garrett feels flat and it is disconcerting because previous games did such a good job creating his persona via narrated snapshootslatest comments may  after my frustrations with the game on release date i have to let it go for a while  limited time and better games took precedence  just the last weekend april   i tackled chapter  and   i wanted to rush in when i stumbled into the bank heist and for this side mission i felt i was back into a thief game  so this weekend may  i got into some of the side quests and finally starting to enjoy this game  until the sound drop out so the bottom line is that this is an enjoyable game when it works but you may want to wait until the game is at a great discount before you try|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|necas first rambo figure was pretty lackluster too boyish fortunately it quickly improved its technique and came out with this version the face and body sculpt look just like stallone necas new transcluscent plastic gives the figures skin a lifelike appearance much better than painted skin tones he comes with a gun rifle walkie talkie knife and spear in addition you can take his camp disguise off if you just want the shirt and jeans version overall definitely recommended for rambo fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|my recommendation for this set depends quite a bit on the price i bought it during a massive sale and got it for the price of about a figure and a half at that price its a steal however i wouldnt pay too much for the set unfortunately its filled mostly with repacks or slight variations granted all of the figures are well made and have solid paint applications so if you dont have three or more of the characters in this set this would be a great way to get themhowever theres nothing truly exciting here except possibly dookus droid fa which is the only truly allnew figure sun fac received some new joint articulation but honestly the  figure still holds up pretty well and this release doesnt include his staff the clone troopers helmet is a bit too big for his body a problem that plagues clone troopers in the hasbro line the battle droid sandtrooper and tie pilot are all great if you need more of those most collectors probably dont the bonus droid is tc  great paint job but not the most exciting droid he was jabbas droid in the clone wars movieoverall my recommendation would be to keep an eye on this and look out for sales|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|im a casual fan of transformers  i dont follow any series now but i used to watch beast wars  when i saw grimlock it reminded me of a cooler version of trex megatron  after getting grimlock i can say that it is a good action figure for kids to play with and casual collectors to enjoy at a budgetin robot mode grimlock looks awesome it stand  tall with ballhinged articulation on the shoulders and hips hinge at the elbows and knees and swivel at the wrist and ankle  it is really a good posable action figure and looks really cool wielding its macein dinosaur mode grimlock has a good resemblance to a trex  unfortunately its likeness to the robotic trex shown on the box stops at the head  this is not to say that grimlock doesnt look good as a trex  imho this one looks better than the elongated grimlock in the leader version  besides this version is clearly designed with kids in mind since at the push of a button you can make this trex open and close its jawwhere hasbro drops the ball is in the instruction leaflet  it only shows grimlock transformation from trex to robot  while you get it on the package as a robot already  but to be honest i had watched videos and i still didnt get it  just be patient and approach this toy with caution  the pictures in the leaflet are small but they do show how the toy should look at every stageonce you get it transformed from one mode to another you will marvel at the engineering  my only concern is the headjawneck transformation because it feels like something may snap in a wrong move  however grimlock feels solid and after a few transformations it feels like it will hold up welloverall i like this version of grimlock a lot  it lacks the chromepainted parts better trex movie resemblance and extra shield of the leader version but it seems easier to play with and its  cheaper|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|when i saw these at the ny toy fair when they premiered i immediately recognized the problem some people will have with her you have to sit her down first to get her ready to flip  that means you can use the whole body to easily push the leg springs in place  whereas if you push her backbutt down its much harder to get those springs in placethis is from the rainbow power line of ponies and has her special rainbow power wings as seen in the last episode of this season as well she has the decals for the special rainbow power symbols in the showrainbow dash is the fastest horse in equestria and so she gets the flipping motion i think shes good for a few times fun but my daughter an avowed rainbow pony fan did get bored of her pretty fast  once the flipping motion gets old then you can push her cutie mark to get phrases  but the phrases all relate to her jumping which is an annoyance after the flipping action gets oldif your child loves mlp they are going to want this and theres very little you can say to dissuade them shes the only pony on the market that really does some kind of action  but also keep in mind that she is larger than the other ponies and so doesnt play well in sets|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my daughter asks all girls with long hair if she can make them pretty  she will stand behind our seated babysitter and play with her hair for  minutes  so this barbie is perfect for her  she has long thick hair that can be brushed though carefully since some of the hair is in locks that end in a heart attachment  she can add the purple pink and blonde extenions  she can clip in the barrettes with a little help and she can pretend to cut barbies hairthe rapunzel doll from disney is a little more fun on the hair styling side crazy thick long blonde hair but this one has the added fun of the attachments  as with all dolls that end up in bed and on the floor and everywhere else her hair does get very messy  however my daughter and i together can tame her hair  my daughter also loves the tiara|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|here yet again is another barbie dvd tiein doll that just doesnt do the transforming properly  on our doll the tail never clips back into place so she pretty much stays in pink mode  she does look like the mermaid from the dvd however so girls will want her for that but keep in mind you can get the vanilla mermaid dolls for half the pricemy  year old enjoys the movie so it isnt too big a deal that she doesnt work as promised but i think any little girl over the age of  will be sophisticated enough to be frustrated by the doll as well the comb doesnt fit into place and my experience with previous barbie mermaids that had a tail comb always ends up with the comb being lost its a useless gimmick for young kidsnote that she isnt really articulated except for the waist so posing is limited there have been some great mermaid dolls in the past from mattel that had rubbery fish tails that could bend at the knees and felt better than this hard plastic doll  but lets face it if a child wants the doll that looks like the mermaid from the dvd thats what you are going to get  even if you could get a better mermaid for cheaper|ham
A1POFVVXUZR3IQ|my daughter was eager to try this new barbie mermaid princess doll in the bath the long lustrous hair which is barbies trademark transforms in water with the hair color changing this was a cool feature but its also a feature of some other barbie dolls that my daughter already has the comb hidden away in the fin is a cute idea but it isnt as easy to fit back in the bonus of having the mermaids tail flip when you touch the dolls pearl necklace into a gowns train is neat and my daughter liked this feature best of all although it doesnt always seem to work well i do wonder how the dolls special features will hold up to repeated use by younger and persistent fingers|ham
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|this listing says these are by mattel and that theyre  scale  well we started a collection of mattel  scale planes for our grandson last christmas and just so you know the very chunky bulldog pictured here is definitely not the long slim and sleek bulldog we purchased  id do some checking to make sure these are what they claim to be prior to ordering  unsuspecting grandparents might also want to keep in mind that most youngsters wont want bravo without his buddy echo or zed without his cohort ned and it wouldve made a lot more sense to include jolly wrenches dusty who pairs up with bravo  echo rather than the racing dusty included in this set  this seems like a set definitely intended to prompt you to have to purchase more|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|sofia is a great diseny junior television series about a very nice and gracious little girl who becomes a princess  it allows my  year old daughter to learn ways to deal with difficult or challenging reallife situations  the floating palace episode first aired in november of   my children  year old boy and  year old girl dont watch sofia normally  theyve seen only a few episodes  but when they saw the previews for this special edition of sofia they had me record it  and since then theyve watched it so many times that they know most of the words to a cute song in the episode called merroway coveso when i saw this toy i was so happy  my daughter has acted out sofia and her mermaid friend oona and has even put things in her hair and said dont steal my comb sea monster like in the show  sofia and her family arrive in beautiful merroway cove for vacation and sofia is reading a book about mermaids she and clover her little bunny friend that she can talk to thanks to her magical amulet of avalor see oona the mermaid checking out the floating palace oona hurts her tail and when she tries to help her sofia finds that her amulet transforms her into a mermaid  sofia meets oonas mother queen emmaline and finds that the merfolk fear humans enough that they actively plan to try and destroy the floating palacemeanwhile cedric turns himself into a sea monster and goes after oona to steal her magic hair comb  sofia does all she can to try to save the kidnapped oona and thus save her family from oonas mother and gets some assistance and a song from ariel  one of the overall lessons in the story is that sofias family doesnt believe her and sofia has be be resourceful to surmount her challenges  in the end she saves oona with her sister coras help which results in sofias family meeting all of the merfolkthe episode has so many things in it that my daughter has already reenacted now that she has this very cute first vacation playset  the playset has to be assembled by snapping all the pieces together some are very easy and some are challenging to the point where i gave it to my husband to dothe water portion is collapsible it looks like the palace is amidst waves when collapsed and when popped up there is a water slide and captains wheel on the lower water levelthe palace has good detail and includes stairs which my daughter is fascinated with we built a lego death star and she spends a ton of time just having luke or leia climbing around the death star  there is a table and chairs on the bottom palace level and stairs up to the top landing and a captains wheel  the lattice door on the first floor opens and there is a gate at the back that opens right above the slide  lots of good detail and playability  as a side note the design is understandably a bit different from the floating palace in the tv episode  it is compact to the extent that my daughter cant really get sofia up the steep stairs when she has her wide skirt onit comes with a small sofia and her skirt snaps open to reveal a mermaid tail  my daughter loved her  i only wish this set came with oona since she likes acting out things between sofia and oona  there is a little clamshell on the sea floor that lifts up that has a picture of oona on itthis set is very tall though it did seem a little bigger in the video like other toys with similar setups plastic sets slides its pricey  its very similar to ariel sets we have purchased that are made speficially for the bathtub  however it has good detail and different interactive elements including a life preserver swingmy  year old thought it was a great set too  he usually has a this is a girls toy attitude about his sisters toys but he played with this and was encouraged by how much my daughter loved it  i do find it a little genderoverkill to have the product listing have  instances of saying girls will enjoy this toy and zero instances of boys but thats typical strict gender differentiation these dayswe had a few snaptogether challenges and its hard to sit sofia on the chairs she bends in half to sit but falls over easily otherwise id give it a  since my kids love it|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i love things that make my kids love bathtub time and this has worked out nicely to entice my daughter into the bathtub  the playset snaps together easily no instructions needed really and has a couple of features that my daughter really likes  she takes ariel and sends her down the ramp into the water then has her get back on the purple landing walk around to the blue steps walk behind the swing and then down the ramp again into the water  she also clips her into the swing and swings her while she talks to herits not shown in the picture but there are two golden pieces that fit onto the railing  they make it prettier but the top golden arch makes it so that you have to move ariel sideways onto the slide and then perch her arms on top of the railing she slides down the railing on her arms  the lower golden arch is wide enough at the top so that she slides right under it  the dolls arms seem to be purposely designed that way outstretched in a t like a ballerina so that the doll goes down the slide without toppling before falling into the bathtub waterpros easy assembly suction cups were great quality stick well to the wall and packaged well so they didnt get warped cute design on ariel the dress has petals that fly open when you twirl her on the purple base then cause her to float in the water ariel snaps into the swing easily clips around her waist you have to swing lightly as its close enough to the wall that the backswing hits the wall if you swing hard the steeple top is removable takes a little bit of pulling its snug and my daughter can pour water into the top and watch it come out as bars of water through the holes a little bigger than i thought it would be and i feel like the value is there for the price just under twenty buckscons the other petal float princesses rapunzel cinderella and belle cost about the same as this whole set right nowas ariel is my daughters favorite disney character she loves this  it is specifically designed for water so at the bottom is a round piece that fits into the flower spinner  once in the water the dress petals pop open and you dont see the feet portion but my daughter did ask if i could take the round piece off and put on ariels mermaid tail while she was in the water  i explained that this was while ariel was a human  she was fine with it after that|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|note that this was an exclusive to target stores  so if you are purchasing it on amazon it likely has been marked up in price quite a bit by marketplace sellersthe equestria girls dolls come in two version  deluxe and normal  the normal dolls do not have articulation and their handslegs dont bend  they wear the outfits that the girls wore through much of the movie  the deluxe versions however are much more posable and wear outfits from the dance at the end of the movie  my  year old liked the deluxe versions more because they can sit better and had more hairthe dolls are about bratz sized  and like the bratz dolls the shoes pop off at the ankle and there are no feet  each doll has a slot at the back where wings can be attached though not all dolls come with wings  they all have the same mold though painted differently and with different hairthe dolls can pretty much stand on their own  so they make great displays when not in playnote that the hair does get ratty easy in the back and thats why i rate this  out of  stars|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|im a casual fan of transformers i must admit that hound was not a transformer that i remembered from any series therefore it didnt interest me  however i would have made a huge mistake if i had passed on it because this is a mean transformer that live up well to both of its modesin robot mode hound looks awesome really pictures do not make it justice  it stand  tall with ballhinged articulation on the shoulders and hips hinge at the elbows and knees and swivel at the wrist and thighs it is really an awesome action figure and looks really cool wielding its many guns  i mean it even have strips of bullets sculpted on rubberyplastic sleeves over its forearmsin vehicle mode hound looks spot on as a medium defense tactical vehicle  all its robot parts are well hidden underneath  it can even carry many weapons on its sides  it looks a bit weird as these weapons were meant to be used by hand but it adds a lot of character to this truck  even the main gun was designed to transform to be carried on the left side  very ingeniousthis time hasbro surprised me with the instruction leaflet  this one shows the transformation of hound from robot to vehicle as it is already in robot form from the package  even as the pictures are a bit small in the case of hound they work ok because hound has a standard vehicle transformation where his chest is the main drivers cabin and his legs are the back wheelsoverall i like hound a lot because it is both an awesome robot and a great vehicle|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|there are a lot of problems with this figure but despite that i love it playmates released pictures of a prototype with much better paint applications the picture shown on amazons page but the final product still works heres the rundowngood great head sculpt the head really looks like an angry warthog i love how the two tusks stick far out above the lip the articulation works well and the head has a surprising range of movementbad the paint application is pretty basic theres no weathering on the figure i think that generally works for a cartoony figure with a few exceptions the spikes on the spike bracelets are left in the original molded black not painted silver bebops glasses are purple rather than blue like in the original cartoon the bod proportions are topheavy bebops upper arms and chest and head are just too big for his relatively scrawny legs theres no ankle articulation so your options in posing him are pretty limitedoverall this figure along with rocksteady is a bit of a letdown compared to last years tmnt classics figures but its is still worth getting for fans of bebop in the  tmnt cartoon compared to the rocksteady figure this one is of better quality overall but i think playmates made some design choices that just dont sit well with me|spam

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO|i have gotten other collectible figures in the past all of them star wars but this batman from greg capullo is my first superhero collectible ever  now that i have this figure in my hands i can say that im very pleased with the final product  this figure still has some issues but for an action figure at this price range and scale it is a very awesome onethis batman is based on greg capullos artwork  im not familiar with this artist but i has been missing a lot  now that my favorite writerartist team buccellatomanapul took over detective comics i got an opportunity to jump into a batman comic  so of course i needed an iconic action figure of batman a good excuse of course and this one is it for melet me get some stats out of the way balljoined head hinged torso swivel waist ballhinged shoulders swivel biceps hinged elbows swivel gloves ballhinged wrists balljoined hips swivel thighs hinged higher and lower knees and hinged anklesthe articulation on this figure is most obvious at the torso hips and thighs  the peg holes are not covered at all and on top of that my figure has a more obvious gap on the right thigh  however the double knee articulation on this figure is much better than from other competitors say star wars black series   the range of posability on this figure is really good even as there are limits on the shoulder and hip articulation due to the sculpt  by the way the tone definition of batman muscles is just greatthe paint on these figure is really good as well  chest insignia gloves and boots are glossy black  the mask and cape are matte black  the suit is matte gray with the indented lines to match the new style  the suit also include glossy knee protectors and a matte yellow belt  the flesh tone on the jaw is in between matte and glossy but most importantly the eyes are painted white  unfortunately my figure came with a small scratch on his left glovethis figure doesnt include many accessories but enough considering other superheroes  batman include three batarangs which he can wield between the thumb and fingers in his left hand  his other hand is sculpted on a closed fist but this is perfect for batmanafter being bitten by the batman bug i decided this was going to be the batman for my collection  the other acceptable batman for me was from the arkham cityasylum games  however those figures tend to look bulkier and show the blue pupils on batman eyes  this is not to say i wouldnt get one of those eventually bottom line this figure sports an amazing sculpt paint and articulation  there some issues with quality control but not enough to knocked down a full star  i love this figure and that matches amazon  stars review which is good enough for me|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|seems to us like disneys really gotten into this marketing ploy of creating certain characters who only appear in localized versions of their movies  we havent heard anything about the planes localized characters being produced on a limited basis the super chase cars  guys were and made them outrageously expensive but when we heard about gunnar viking who appears in the swedish version of planes and saw him for  with free shipping we went ahead and purchased him for our older grandsons th birthday though we recognize that price is well over twice mattels  msrp for their regular individual  scale planes characters  as was the case for flash gunnars paint job reflects the colors of the swedish flag with nordic printed on his sides sporting the number  and hes really neat looking  the back of the card says he started out as an air ambulance but traded his sirens for racing stripes when a sports reporter noticed his speedy flying times  weve also found the mattel  scale models although they feel to us more like a sturdy plastic than diecast metal to be extremely durable much moreso than the  scale disney store models which  in our opinion  should come with a tube of super glue holding up well under the aggressive rigors of racing our grandson subjects them to  we know gunnar will bring a great big smile to his face come april  boy he is getting older a lot faster than grandpa  i are|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|modeled after an extra ea were learning all about aircraft models while reading up on these planes characters mattels version of yellow bird is really a handsome looking american plane with his striking yellow color contrasting with the black checkered pattern on his sides and tip of his right wing and his racing number  on the other wing and his tail  actually its a little weird in the movies wings around the globe rally hes shown as both  and  mattel obviously decided on  for the  scale diecast version double check this listing before ordering one because this photo shows the  and there are cheap models of planes out there that are nothing but super cheap plastic without moving wheels even though this listing claims to be mattel  we started a collection of the  scale mattel models for our older grandson now  last christmas and grandpa  i have enjoyed being in the audience during innumerable races  we added to the collection for his april birthday but yellow bird hadnt been released yet in fact as of this writing we still havent seen it sold singly as a packaged item only included in a target  pack called take to the skies and we already have the other  that are included fortunately weve got another  months until christmas to search for him as a single so we can be patient and wait until we find him for closer to his   msrphaving experienced both mattels  scale and disney stores  scale items from his cars  collection we went with the mattel models when we started on the planes collection  although disney stores are super neat not only larger but also definitely a much heavier metal concentration than mattels which feel more like a very strong plastic to us it was annoying to have to keep supergluing back on pieces of the disney store models  just an accidental drop to the floor and off would pop a spoiler or something else let alone the onpurpose crashes that happen during races  the mattel planes have held up really well even when our  year old grandson gets hold of one and throws it  his way of participating i guess but not one his older brother is happy about|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|if youve got a little person just discovering planes and are wondering what the difference is between super charged dusty and racing dusty youre in the same boat grandpa  i were last christmas when we began a collection of these mattel  scale models for our older grandson  one of the biggest differences is that racing dusty main character dusty crophopper in his original form has a  blade yellow tips propeller while this one is super charged with a  blade green tips propeller and jets on the ends of his wings none on racing  other instantly noticeable differences are a silver nose versus orange on racing black coloring on both sides of his fuselage versus light blue on racing there are actually several differences when you compare them side by sidewe prefer these models to disney stores larger  scale ones  disney stores look great and the heavier metal concentration make them excellent if youre only going to display them  but if your youngsters going to actually play with them as our grandson does these mattel versions feel more like a super durable plastic and they dont have pieces constantly breaking off of them as weve experienced with disney store versions  with these we dont have to worry when the  year old grandsons  year old brother decides to get into the action by flinging them across the room|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|well we figured chug would have to return in the planes sequel  hes a fuel truck who is dustys good friend and biggest supporter similar to lightning mcqueen and mater in the cars town of radiator springs  his mentor skipper and boss leadbottom also return so i was trying to determine if there were enough differences in the diecasts from the separate movies to warrant a purchase of a second version of each  as far as chug goes the differences i see are he has silver bumpers with rust versus the brown bumpers of the first version the far right  left lights on his cab roof protrude upward versus not protruding on the first version looks like a lot more rust or dirt perhaps on his doors and fenders and it appears his hubcaps are silver versus brown on the first version  hmm decisions decisions  in the meantime our  year old grandson is beside himself with excitement about going to see the sequel with us on april th and meeting all of the new characters who work together putting out wildfires at piston peak  i was at walmart a couple days after writing this review and they were just putting up a fire  rescue display chug just didnt look different enough to justify a second purchase but i was able to pick up  of the figures for just  a piece  a lot better than amazons  price as of today so thats where ill be getting the rest of his collection unless amazon comes down and saves me a tripthe mattel diecast collections cars  and the original planes have just been such a great investment for us with two grandsons already and another due to arrive in september  the feel is more of an extremely sturdy plastic rather than metal but weve found thats exactly what makes them stand up to rougher play than the disney stores larger  scale models  their handsome display cases is probably where they ought to stay the much heavier metal concentration means the small pieces are more brittle and break off so easily  weve really been pleased with the level of durability and the planes models have lived in our home for  months with all propellers and wheels still intact despite more nosedives than we can begin to count  would love to see them end up in the hands of our great grandkids someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|mattel had come out with  different  scale versions of main character dusty crophopper from the original planes movie racing dusty supercharged dusty jolly wrenches dusty and it looks like theyre doing the same thing with the sequel this firefighter dusty as well as a racer dusty and pontoon dusty  i already know this one will be our grandsons favorite with his sharp redblackwhite color scheme as compared to the orangelight bluewhite of the other two versions  were all including grandpa  hes taking a day off from work to go with us on july th so excited to meet all of the new characters who team together to put out wildfires at piston peak  we understand that dusty incurred a racing careerending injury during a training run and is now a trainee working with the piston peak air attack team  having been so pleased with the level of quality of the same scale cars  diecasts we collected for our then  now  year old grandson we decided to start another with the characters from the original planes movie last christmas  we were a little worried about whether the propellers and wheels would stay intact especially since wed added a then  now  year old grandson who enjoys seeing how far he can throw his brothers toys  well were  months in and all of the planes are in super shape  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a couple of days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick firefighter dusty up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todaywhen we started the cars  collection we  purchased both mattels and disney stores larger  scale models trying to decide which models to pursue  received our answer immediately  the disney store models that had looked so cool in their display cases did not hold up to accidental drops off of the coffee table let alone a  year old brother  the heavier metal concentration meant we had  pieces like spoilers etc breaking off constantly  mattels models feel more like super strong plastic rather than metal to us but our experience has shown us that theyre the ones that will have the degree of durability well need to go through three grandsons we have a third due around labor day so they can hopefully make it into our great grandkids hands one day|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|we thought it was pretty clever of disney to use a carstoons installment air mater to introduce a place called propwash junction the hometown of main character dusty crophopper in disneys planes movie and also where our grandson first saw judge davis who was the official air judge and main announcer at the air shows in propwash junction  though he has a minor role in planes hes such a cool looking plane based on the north american pc mustangs that were flown during wwii he sports the number  has black and white stripes on his wings and back sign panels stars a bright red tail and other bits of color here and there  judge davis is one of several diecast planes theyve come out with in  that have easter egg packaging the others we heard about were supercharged dusty crophopper ripslinger bulldog and arturo but we were especially excited about judge davis since he hasnt been previously introduced as a diecast  we wanted to make sure to have him in time for our grandsons birthday box of new planes items to add to the collection we started for him last christmas  our time constraints meant we had to swallow hard and pay over double the  msrp for these mattel diecasts free shipping but at least that was a lot better than the  amazon is asking as of today but if you can be patient we heard these guys will be in select grocery stores where youll be able to find them much more reasonably pricedwe knew from experience with mattels versions of the cars compared to disney stores versions that mattels  planes models were the right ones for us  though disney stores cars and planes are very neat looking larger  scale and made with a heavier diecast metal compared to the feel of very sturdy plastic that we think the mattel models have we always had trouble with pieces breaking off which was very frustrating  durability is the name of the game for us since were hoping well be able to box up his collections and save them for sometime in the future when he can reintroduce them to his own kids|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|trike feldman is a red piaggio ape who sold merchandise featuring lightning mcqueens arch rival francesco bernoulli in the cars  movie  his scene comes during the porto corsa italy race  well grandpa  i should have done a little more research prior to spending a total of  shipping  handling this past february for this cute little super chase addition thats a big chunk of change for a diecast  that feels more like sturdy plastic  that measures just   length   width and    tall with flags atop  the super chase figures have come with a much higher price tag than the typical  msrp for the regular figures due to their limited production in trikes case only  made worldwide  wed already invested close to  in the racers vitaly petrov fernando alonso memo rojas jr long ge and flash for our older grandson so when they began coming out with additional limited edition figures we decided to keep collecting them for our younger grandsonweve always believed in quality collections hoping that if we invested now and hid them away theyd increase in value so that our grandsons could either keep them as special momentos of their childhoods or sell them at a much heftier price than were purchasing them for right now  unless something changes trike  although quite darling  appears to be one that might not increase in value and we think we know why  rather than accurately reflecting his appearance in the movie the flags that are included and slide into slats on the top of his grey cart are american flags not italian flags as in the movie and as any francesco vendor worth his salt would be carrying  although theres a red f on a pole in among the american flags you cant tell what any of the other souvenirs on his cart are supposed to be and though theres some red green  white colored stuff francescos colors as well as those of the italian flag there are also turquoise blue things  we think its so strange that mattel made a move like this particularly when the back of the package confirms who trike is supposed to be if you are a francesco fan catch trike feldman as he scoots around selling souvenirs of everything francesco  jeesh  hope the others we purchased for our younger grandson yukio hiroaki and takeshi along with the latest one we found  fans luigi  guido scoot on upward in value over the years because we think mattel miscalculated on this one  and us hate it when that happens|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|my gosh target has come out with so many multi packs  we took advantage of a few of them when we started a mattel  scale diecast collection for our older grandson last christmas  unfortunately the more they come out with the more duplicates are appearing so we couldnt make use of this one since we already had rochelle the french canadian racer  but if youre just starting out this has three of the newer ones sunwing a chinese biplane gunnar viking a swedish racer and jan kowalski a polish racer  theyre all competitors in the wings around the globe rally in disneys planes movie and we can tell you that our now  year old grandson has thoroughly enjoyed racing around with these durable guys  galsthey actually have the feel of a very sturdy plastic but thats what weve come to prefer over disney stores larger  scale models even though theyre much heavier with a higher metal concentration  unfortunately our experience with our grandsons cars  collection we had both mattel and disney store models was that although disney stores were very sharp looking they didnt have nearly the same level of durability as the mattel versions  our older grandson has a  year old brother who occasionally gets hold of big brothers toys when hes not looking and pieces kept breaking off of his disney store guys  when planes came along we decided on the mattel versions right away since we werent interested in purchasing stock in super glue|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|if your youngsters just now discovering disneys planes movie and its characters and you plan on purchasing more than a couple the various multi packs targets come out with most of the big box stores have multipacks are really terrific if you can find them for a decent price target had their  packs for  last christmas season but we think they mightve gone up a buck or so  still fair given the   msrp for the characters sold individually  it prevents you from having to hunt all over town for each one individually and we took advantage of several of them  this is the latest one as of this writing seems they come out with new ones all of the time and includes two of the new  releases tsubasa a japanese racer and yellow bird an american racer as well as a couple of previous releases  ljh special who competes with main character dusty crophopper at the time trials for the wings around the globe rally but doesnt make the top  and the legendary mexican racer el chupacabra  in fact thats the only thing about the multipacks there are some duplications so you pretty much need to have a plan of attack to get the ones your little one wants the mostweve come to favour these mattel  scale diecast versions we think they feel more like a really sturdy plastic than metal over disney stores heaviermetalconcentrated larger  scale models  disney stores are super neat looking but our experience from our grandsons cars  collection was that they didnt hold up nearly as well as mattels so we went with the  scale when we started his planes collection last christmas  not unusual for the two groups to visit each other at either radiator springs or propwash junction|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W| fans luigi  guido  being lightning mcqueens racing number are the latest super chase guys we purchased a couple of weeks ago for our younger grandson having already purchased the super chase racers vitaly petrov fernando alonso memo rojas jr long ge and flash for our older one  theyre two of the five radiator springs pals lightning mcqueen takes along as his pit crew during the country world grand prix in the cars  movie and this super chase version has them all decked out in their mcqueen fan gear  absolutely irresistible  back home in radiator springs luigi designed as a yellow fiat  is the owner of casa della tires and his assistant guido designed as a blue forklift is a whiz at changing tires  the super chase version has luigi sporting a red visor covered in lightning mcqueen symbols and poles with american flags protruding from his door windows and guido  our favorite  has a huge well considering his diminutive size its huge redyellow wig with a  sign against an american flag background attached to one prong of his fork lift and a lightning bolt attached to the other  be aware that when we say theyre tiny they are luigi is    length    tall at the top of his visor and   wide while guido is    length    tall at the top of his wig and   wide a little bit wider if you count the extra poofiness of the wig  just too cute for words they join the others weve collected for our younger grandson thus far yukio hiroaki takeshi and trike feldmanwhats not too cute is the hefty price tag we paid a total of  price  shipping a couple of weeks ago but were hoping itll only increase in value in the coming years  the reason they can get away with charging so much more than the normal  msrp for the regular cars  diecasts is that the super chase items are limited editions in this case only  were manufactured worldwide  probably not something youre going to buy for the neighborhood birthday party but if youve got a special little one in your life or youre going to hold onto them until later as we plan to its pretty much guaranteed that these little italian buddies would be a winning combo|spam
