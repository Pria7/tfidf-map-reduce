A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|i didnt really want to review conquest of nerathits not that i dont like board games but that i just dont have as much time to play them  my xbox  playstation  tivo and d modern tabletop roleplaying games all compete for time on my calendar but then wizards of the coast offered me a chance to playtest conquest of nerath and i just couldnt say noconquest of nerath is a risklike tabletop strategy game that involves moving armies across territories  reminiscent of the might  magic games conquest of nerath has two scales army and hero scale  armies which range from creatures to castles soldiers to ships can only play across the terrain heroes which include fighters and wizards are an asset to an army and can also go dungeon crawling  which lets face it is the whole point of playing a ddthemed version of riskive been railing against the decoupling of dungeons  dragons from toy stores for over a decade now and its refreshing to see wizards of the coast finally get it conquest of nerath is not just dd in name alone  it has a format and layout similar to thedition dungeons  dragons the terrain pieces are littered with familiar places like the temple of elemental evil and the tomb of horrors and the four different dragons actually look like their tabletop roleplaying game counterparts  conquest of nerath is proud of its roots and it harkens back to the original dungeons  dragons set in utilizing heroes on the battlefieldthere are also several stylistic flourishes that appeals to veteran roleplayers  gaming grognards will recognize the aforementioned staples of dungeon crawling but also have a weakness for dice guilty the number of dice determines a monsters hits and you inflict one hit by rolling above a  on various dice  dragons in case youre wondering roll a d conquest of nerath comes with a lot of dice but be warned  you will not have enough  but then again if youre anything like me you have plenty of dice within each reach if not stuck in your couch somewhere if you like dice youre going to love conquest of nerathas a matter of necessity the four armies of plastic pieces that come with the set are not mm scale  theyre probably more appropriate to a mm scale although some are not necessarily scalespecific  ogres could easily pass as goblins treants could easily pass assmaller treants  for those looking for repaints this set wont provide much fodder unless you plan to use the smaller scale in which case  buys you four armiesthere are also event cards that mix up the game as well as treasure cards earned from dungeon crawling if the games gorgeous design falls somewhat flat its on the cards which lack pictures  if i win a vorpal sword after battling a medusa i want to see itspeaking of medusa wizards and certain monsters have a first strike ability  normally all damage is inflicted simultaneously which ensures mutual destruction  but wizards have the ability to attack first before the opponent inflicts damage  they also can dungeon crawl  although the damage they inflict is smaller first strike is a very powerful ability and i ended up hording wizards as quickly as i couldif conquest of nerath has a flaw its the fiddly bits pieces for the dungeons which could just as easily have been cards treasury tokens that could easily be handled by counters and victory points that could also have been handled by counters  i prefer less pieces but then again i may be biased by my mobile oneyearolds propensity to eat anything she can catchconquest of nerath is a long overdue game that bridges the gap between tabletop dungeon crawls and board games its about time dd got a decent shot at the mainstream game audience  now all we need are conversion rules to integrate the conquest of nerath into mass combat rules for tabletop playyou can learn more about conquest of nerath at wizard of the coasts web site|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|when the global economy went south and the cost of importing products from china went up the miniature market took a severe hit  miniatures are often molded and painted overseas which requires a considerable amount of manpower  to make up the cost of creating and shipping the miniatures they were sold in blind randomized packs to ensure that every miniature sold at a minimum base value when shipping and production costs went up this tactic became less effective and wizards of the coast pulled their dungeons  dragons miniatures line entirely now theyre back with dungeon commandwizards has found considerable success in adapting the th edition dungeons  dragons rules to the board game market with the adventure system a distribution channel long overdue given that the company is owned by hasbro  dungeon command heralds wizards return to the miniature market as its own skirmish game as game pieces for other adventure system board games like the legend of drizztand oh yeah for tabletop roleplaying gamesinstead of being released in random packs you know exactly what you get with dungeon command  sting of lolth consists of a drow wizard assassin blademaster and priestess two house guards a shadow mastiff two demonweb spiders a giant spider an umber hulk and a partridge in a pear tree ahem no sorry the last component is adrideras dd miniatures supporting a tabletop roleplaying game campaign this is a good spread  any dungeon master utilizing the drow will need a priestess for the matriarchal drow society and her spider minions whats curious is the inclusion of the halfdrowhalfspider driders see what they did there who are considered abominations by the drow and highly unlikely to be part of a warbandfor adventure system players there are  monster cards aligning with each of the miniatures and four interlocking terrain cardsif you just want to play the skirmish game you really should buy another opposing faction see what they did there  but there are rules to play a shortened game with the miniatures you have  after all it wouldnt be the first time drow fought each otherthe real surprise is that there are no dice in this game yes no dice  randomized elements are reserved through command cards and creature cards which are tapped and untapped  so this is basically magic the gathering meets dungeons  dragonsill wait for the traditional dd gamers to stop screamingwhats great about this set is its utility  drow have a strong theme that warrants a collection of this type and because they miniatures are prepainted unlike the unpainted miniatures for the adventure system the components can be used three different ways  in essence wizards didnt create a new game system they just provided new ways to use old miniatures  and thats a pretty sweet deal|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|continuing wizards of the coasts trend of repurposing their blind random miniatures sets for the tabletop version of dungeons  dragons to the board gamer set dungeon command heart of cormyr hopes to be a triple threat of interest to dd players adventure system board gamers and miniature gamersinstead of being released in random packs you know exactly what you get with dungeon command  for traditional tabletop players theres a war wizard a human ranger a halforc thug a halfling sneak two elf archers a dwarf cleric two dwarven defenders a dragon knight an earth guardian and a copper dragon  this collection is pretty much the player racers of dd set with the exception of the oftforgotten gnome  im not too familiar with cormyr but as a set it doesnt seem to hang together as well assting of lolth i would have preferred some sort of golem to an earth guardian and there seems to be an overabundance of dwarves but the copper dragon is a nice additionfor adventure system players there are  monster cards aligning with each of the miniatures and four interlocking terrain cardslike the other sets the skirmish game is adjudicated through movement and cards not dice  this will likely be quite a shock to those who are accustomed to the dd adventure system or tabletop roleplaying gamein fact i think theyre probably still screaming from the revelation in myother reviewdungeon command features a variety of fun components and rules treasure chests dangerous terrain etc that make each skirmish different and interesting  because it interlocks with other terrain from other sets the battlefield can be manipulated in a variety of ways  including flipping the tiles overive compared dungeon command to an unholy union between magic the gathering you can tap cards and dungeons  dragons miniatures you figure it out but thats oversimplifying the game  damage is inflicted simply by moving to a character and attacking which means that youre basically just running around the board most of the time  the real strategy comes into play by using the command cards which add or reduce damage at the moment you attack  its at this point traditional gamers will probably miss their dicewhat this means is that of the three uses for dungeon command miniature gaming is actually the weakest  its not bad but its not nearly as compelling as the adventure system  the challenge then is that the warband makeup matters more and a vanilla tour of the races of dd doesnt really cut it for the other two game formatsits unlikely dms will plunk down the thirty bucks for this set because they need the miniatures in it  drow warband  heck yes  random pcs with a suspicious race bias towards dwarves  not so much|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|ive reviewed previous editions of dungeon command  heres the short summary it uses cards instead of dice to resolve combat its compatible with both the dd adventure system series of board games including the legend of drizzt and tabletop dungeons  dragons and it comes with a series of prepainted plastic miniatures recycled from the cancelled dungeons  dragons miniatures game im less interested in this latest iteration of the miniatures game as i am in its compatibility with other dd gamesthe title should give away what you can expect to find here goblins or rather goblinoids and the creatures who love them  the set comes with a goblin archer two goblin cutters and a goblin champion  these three miniatures can be found unpainted in the legend of drizzt game  it should be pointed out the tiles that come with the set do not perfectly match the underground tiles of the legend of drizzt so while they are physically compatible they dont merge quite perfectly with the adventure system setswith the basics established the set continues with a wolf and a goblin wolf rider apparently wizards of the coast has moved away from the term worg which in turn was drawn from warg the evil wolves named by tolkien as being in league with goblins but the affiliation still stands which explains their inclusion herethere are also two hobgoblins soldiers a bugbear berserker and a hobgoblin sorcerer the sorcerer does more than sorcery  he summons a horned devil which is the only explanation for why this figure is in the set  the horned devil is one of two large figures along with the feral troll who will be right at home in the legend of drizztthere are two commanders tarkon draal black hand of bane who demoralizes opponents and snig the axe who deploys goblin hordes and is still just as mysterious as when he appeared in the cancelled miniatures game as the card says nobody knows if snig is the name of the axe or the goblinthis set focuses on what it does best  goblins combined with the miniatures from the drow dungeon command set you can replace quite a few of the unpainted miniatures of the legend of drizzt with their painted duplicates  while it may not be fancy this set makes an excellent goblin warband for dungeon command adventure system or the roleplaying game|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|i remember playing the original dungeon board game back at my neighbor kennys house  it served as a great recruiting tool for my elementary school friends to get them into playing dungeons  dragons later over thirty years later i played this latest iteration with my fiveyearold sonthe premise of dungeon is the original premise of dungeons  dragons four murder hobos wander into a dungeon grab as much treasure as they can by killing as many monsters as they can and then escape back home with it all the dungeon has a neat order to it with increasingly difficult levels of monsters six in total and correspondingly higher treasure rewards some treasure includes magic swords that give a bonus to attack while others allow the player to see what monster lurks in the nearby roomcombat with each monster can lead to acquiring a treasure or if you are unable to beat a target number with a combined roll of two dice losing treasure ground or even your characters life but dont worry like in the tabletop roleplaying game even death isnt permanentthe original dungeon game had four classes elf hero superhero and wizard corresponding to the original chainmail wargame  yes kids back then we had heroes and superheroes as classes  the s version im more familiar with was retooled to match basic dungeons  dragons dwarf elf paladin thief warrior and wizard so perhaps its no surprise that this latest version has cleric fighter rogue and wizard classesthe wizard a constant through all editions differs significantly from the rest of the classes in his ability to cast spells fireball lightning bolt and teleport and thats part of dungeons brilliance  you can play correspondingly different levels of play by the character you choose  my son played the halfling rogue and i played the human fighter because each class has different levels of gold requirements to win the game each class is encouraged to take more or less risk by venturing into deeper levels of the dungeonone consistent problem with all versions of dungeon is its multitude of pieces  theres cards for monsters treasure and spells cardboard pieces for the classes that dont stand up particularly well magic sword tokens lose a turn tokens and number tokens that i still have no idea what they do but the most egregious tokens are the cleared graveyard markers  when monsters are killed the markers are placed in the room which is fine until you have  and if you jostle the board the tokens slide all over the board  its very easy to lose track of what rooms you cleared as a resultthe other problem is that occasionally youre supposed to draw cards randomly from your collection of treasure but they are clearly marked on one side by level and color  the only way to actually randomly select which treasure you lose is by closing your eyesstill this is a very entertaining game that can be played by players of different levels of skill  even a fiveyearold  who beat me at my own game|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|dont break the ice was one of the few board gametype games i had when i was younger and i always had fun playing it my daughter was interested in the game when i showed her the box thinking it was funny how you lose if the bear crashes through the ice on your turn i ordered the game and once it got here she couldnt wait to play it we ended up playing  rounds in less than  minutes she couldnt wait to play again i was having fun too and its crazy how the little bear manages to stay standing when you smash away the majority of the iceif you havent played the game its really simple you can completely ignore the instructions trust me you snap the two blue tray halves together then squeeze all the blocks of ice in it there are a bunch of small blocks of ice and one big x block which is used to hold the little red bear figure typically this big piece goes in the middle of the tray but you can put it wherever you want once everythings in flip the tray up and you and another player take turns smashing blocks of ice out with the little hammers until the bear falls whoever makes him fall losesas i mentioned there are many times when i was about to go ooh i win when playing because it looked like the bear had no chance of standing up when a certain block would be knocked out only to see him hold his ground the ice blocks are held in very tightly when you get them all in so theres nearly no chance of him falling by accident or the big square falling out i have to warn potential buyers that this game is a bit flimsy the tray could easily snap if you apply too much pressure when putting it together so dont rush anything and youll be fine i also give the game  stars for educational value because it can teach your kids tactics and seeing that if you knock x block out x blocks will go down with it because nothing will hold them in place any moredont break the ice is a great game for a very fair price its good to see that a classic from my childhood is still fun to play over  years later|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|everything about this game was made more complicated for the s setthe board the gameplay even the little people pegs are harder to get in the vehicles cleanup is not a snap as there are more confusing pieces despite trying three times and following the directions i still cannot get the cover to stay onbe flush with the box bottom shoot i cant even follow the general directions for this game get the middishs verison in order to have a fun time hey when i play a game i am trying to escape the reality of life not relive it through cardboard and cheap plastic|ham

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this game is very simple because you just roll the dice and grab the parts you need when you roll the right number but you can still make it educational  i use it for number recognition by having my girls tell me what number the dice is showing and i use it for colors as well  it is a great game|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this is a great first game for kids  it teaches counting taking turns and how to handle setbacks but no reading is required to play  it is also durable unlike some of the other classic games that are coming back  the design of this hasnt really changed from the one i had as a kid|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters  and the only board game shes really played much of is candyland i never played hi ho cherryo when i was little but based on the things ive read it seemed like a safe bet i mean hey she has orange hair and loves dogs so she was already interested based on the box art alone we played this for a good  minutes the other day and she really enjoyed it though she still hates losing of coursehi ho cherryo is easy to play and set up up to  people can play with each person having their own tree or bush to pick fruit from you have cherries blueberries oranges and green apples and  of each fruit are on each tree players take turns spinning an arrow that will land on either a number a bird a dog or a basket if it lands on a number they take that many of their fruit from the tree and put it in their basket if it lands on the bird or dog the animal eats one piece of fruit and the player has to put it back on the tree and if the arrow lands on the basket they lose all their fruit and have to put every piece back on the tree the first person to get  pieces of fruit winslike i said the game is very easy to understand and kids  will probably get the most out of it counting the pieces of fruit whenever the arrow lands on the number its a fun game to play and sometimes a game will take longer than youd think if you constantly get the basket or either animal i couldnt believe it when i got the dog and bird  times in a row and my daughter got the basket three times in one game so close to winning each time only to have me finally win when i started to get numbers she wasnt too happy with thatthe only bad thing i can say about this game is that the construction is on the wimpy side several people have complained about the game board being flimsy and i have to agree though i just had the game box hold the board so it was more stable and we played without any problems its somewhat thin though and i can see it getting all bent up if hyper kids use it but it all depends on the people using it you get  of each fruit piece  to put in the trees and  extra of each which is great of them to do but i cant help but wonder if  extra pieces wouldve been a safer choice given how easy it is to lose things of this size just be careful when playing and keep checking to make sure everyone has their pieces and you should be goodwhat more can i say i highly recommend this game and wish it were around when i was little but nooooi was stuck with the panic attackinducing perfection instead|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this game is actually pretty challenging because of the small size of the pieces and the short amount of time you are given  i like it because it strengthens handeye coordination but i am an adult and usually cant beat this game  if you want your child to have a challenge that they wont soon outgrow consider this game|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember getting this and being quite disappointed the figure sculpt isnt nearly as good as the original darth maul figure the fighting action when you press the buttons is pretty unrealistic also because the arms are so loose to allow that action you cant pose the figure without the lightsaber hilt overall id only recommend this to young kids|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the podracers in the phantom menace were a neat tribute to roman chariot racing although the race itself went on a bit too long sebulbas podracer is probably the most recognizable podracer in the film galoob did a good job with the details on this one however the sebulba figure doesnt fit that well into the cockpit its a bit looseer than id like still this vehicle is definitely a must for podracer fans its just a shame more of the podracers werent produced before the action fleet line ended|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this potf figure has aged pretty well this was one of the firs hasbro figures with any real sense of modern articulation his knees bend although his arms dont his blaster is movie accurate and fits in a holster the paint job and sculpt still look like harrison ford of course there are more recent versions but if you find this one hes still worth getting|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this set is pretty old and there are now better updated versions of both labria and nabrun leids the paint job of the figures included in this set isnt that realistic labria looks a sickly yellow while nabrun leids spacesuit isnt shiny enough the only figure in this set not in those others is takeel although there are other versions of snaggletooth out there i guess it cant hurt to have more cantina aliens but id recommend getting the other ones|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i like this toy  i thought about getting the gears building table by the same company learning resources but thats about  once you get the gears to go with it and this set serves the same purpose  the only difference is that you have to build a platform with the square bases first but thats fine with me  this also takes up less room  i love how open ended this toy is but it would have gotten a full  stars if there were different sizes of gears in it  i plan to purchase an additional set so we get more pieces|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a lovely addition to a thomas wooden set which we received after putting it on our amazon wish listwhat you should know right away the set features one  way joiner track in the front that ends in a single track  if youre like me and youre building your thomas set for your child you may not have additional switch track pieces that branch to form two tracks  this means that your childs nice circular set or figure  set as we have wont be circular any more  the tracks leading out of the back of the sheds dont have connectorsso the roundhouse is a stopping point unless you purchase or have a splitter to branch back to both ends of your circular track  so make sure you get a splitter too if you dont have onemy son absolutely loves it and i do as well  its fun to open the doors and send the engines to sleep  we also led one track around the back and hes able to complete his circular voyage by doing a little hop with the trains over the small gap where there is no connector using the roundhouse like a tunnel he doesnt have any problems opening the doors and the quality on the construction is wonderful and it is just gorgeous taking his set to a new level  i was surprised by how big it was it takes up a sizeable space on his thomas tableit is a great piece to add to your set because it offers a really different kind of interaction  most everything else is something the trains pass by or over but this one has great interactivity with the doors and pulling the engines through as well as being a stoppingstorage point for the enginesjust ignore the picture on the amazon listing that shows the turntable as that isnt a part of the set  frankly im glad he loves to make longish trains and that causes all sorts of problems when he tries to use the turntable on his take and play set|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|folkmanis puppets are some of the best you can get and this labrador is no exception my daughter got one of these for christmas since my brother has a labrador that she loves to play with while i still think their galapagos tortoise is the best this guy definitely ranks in the top  of folkmanis puppets because of how expressive you can make him kids who love dogs will go nuts over this and if you like to read stories while using puppets to make them come to life i cant think of any better dog puppetsthe lab is pretty big and an absolute steal at the price its going for how often do you see stuffed animals half this size going for the same price hes super soft the legs and ears are all floppy moving around a lot when you move the dog back and forth to walk the hole for your hand is on his stomach and not too big or small so kids and adults can use it without any trouble what i liked the most is that the inside of the mouth doesnt have any cardboard or stiff materials to have the mouth keep one shape if youve ever seen the muppet show youll know kermits trademark grumpy face where he scrunches his mouth up thanks to the mouth design here you can do that with the dog too it looks hilarious since the dog looks more shocked and disgusted than anything while its suggested for kids  theres nothing that could hurt any younger kids here my one complaint and this is something odd to say about folkmanis is that the quality control on these dogs seems a little off the one my daughter got has its right eye engulfed by the fur around it making the poor thing look like a pirate dog or something others ive seen in stores have the nose lopsided or upside down and ive seen one or two where the stuffing looked like it couldve been better if you have a store nearby that carries these check around for a good one if you can but chances are that most kids wont care about imperfections like these as long as the puppets funwhich it ishopefully in the coming months well be getting a few more folkmanis puppets for storytelling and just playing around my daughter loves having this labrador around and she still plays with him on a regular basis|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a nice card game for girls  and up  it features  equestrian themed events jumper hunter equitation dressage  and the object is to collect blue ribbons  players take turn alternating who hosts a show  and depending on the number of players there will be  events per show  certain horses in your hand will have a better chance than others in certain shows  and some horses have penalties for a particular ribbon  there is a bit of strategy  but not so much that younger children are at a disadvantage against older kids or their parentsmy daughter really likes the horse theme and the cards have lovely images on them  in all we greatly enjoyed this game|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we put this table and the standard table top on our amazon wish list and fortunately our sons aunt got it for him  we had just been through construction nightmares on another piece of furniture and were fearing the worst when this arrivedunlike other furniture weve purchased online just to find it arrives with damaged corners and missing parts this was extremely securely packaged with protective styrofoam each piece separated by its own molded area  dont have any shipping fears  another nice surprise  pieces are preassembled so that you only pull out five pieces the arched end pieces the side rails and the little middle rail that supports the table top  the table comes with a little box of hardware  pieces and what i must say is an adorable golden wrench  it took us  minutes to assemble and we didnt even have to look at the very easy instructions or get any other toolsthe table is gorgeous vibrantly colored and durable  my  year old son absolutely loves the little extruded train faces along the sides  its the perfect height for him and takes a lot of leaning and bashing no problem  mommy loves it too because it fits a big wooden set with plenty of parking room for all his engines which means they arent all over my housewe keep a little chair by it but he prefers to just move around and around or sit on his knees playing with it  it really completes the thomas set for usyes its pricey but keep in mind the resale value  ive never seen a thomas table below  on craigslist in our area|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|mcfarlanes where the wild things are figures were pretty much perfect as a whole and emil continues the trend he was the third wild thing figure i got and though he wasnt exactly a favorite of mine in the book i love this figure in fact it made me appreciate the design and realize how cool he islike the others emil is a fairly heavy figure with a flawless sculpt every feather is right there with little scratches in his talons and beak just like they appear in the book and of course he has the trademark ink scratch design too you can move his arms and tail around and hes one of the only wild things that can stand on his own without the base though youll probably want to have him on it just to match the other figures if you go for the whole set theres not a bad thing i can say about the look of this figure like all the others mcfarlne got the colors down perfectly just like they did the transition from d drawing to d sculptbut he has the same problem as all the other figures hes fragile luckily emil isnt as heavy as the big boys like moishe aaron and bernard and his weight is balanced pretty evenly but his tail and arms are prone to breaking off if you pull a little too hard so be careful also you might want to watch it if your kids play with him because his talons and head feathers are a bit pokeyfigures like this make me wish mcfarlane would lay off halo and sports and go back to the truly unique licenses emil would make not only a great addition to your toy collection but of course compliments the other wild things even if you didnt care much for him in the book seeing this toy in person will probably change your mind|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|theres nothing new to say here as with my other wild thing figure reviews this sets stupendous max and goatboy are probably the most soughtafter because of max and just like the others theyre worth the price as long as its not super expensive getting these figures in the mail put a big smile on my face and took me back to the days when i wanted that wolf costume oh hell i still want that wolf costumemax looks great though the only minor problem is that his face looks a bit chubby no big deal though because anyone who sees this figure and knows the book will instantly recognize him the mcfarlane masters did a great job sculpting him in his wild pose and because of how his tail rests on the ground max can stand up on his own he has plastic wire whiskers and a crown and scepter that you can decorate him with he has slight articulation at the tail arms and leg goatboy is just as good and you gotta love the eyes on him hes easily the smallest of the wild things and much lighter as well mine hasnt broken and i havent read anything on him breaking for anyone else he can also stand on his own both of course have the scratched ink style on them as wellmax though also has one big problem with how he was made and its the same thing as the other big wild things he breaks very easily youd think that since hes smaller that wouldnt be a problem especially since goatboys a little bigger and has no problems nope my maxs tail broke off during shipping and was floating around in the box i glued it on with no problem but it broke again after a few weeks his left arm also broke right at the point of articulation and needed repairing as well while mcfarlane sculpted all of these perfectly i dont get what happened with the quality of the plasticjust keep an eye out for max as a whole and youre good to go with these guys when they first came out they were already a good deal since youre getting two figures for the price of one and its still a good deal its just too bad goatboy cant ride aaron|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|i agree with the previous itsjustok reviewers that this game is a glorified version of war directions are printed up slightly awkwardly and slightly confusingly to this day i am not sure if i actually reading them correctly and thus missing something instrumental to this game that would make it fabulous sometimes its over much too quickly other times it seems endless and brain numbing my daughter and i both get quickly bored when playing this game the food chain and general sea life education are cool bonuses but alas that fact cannot save this game from me an animal at the apex of the chain with the power to pass this game on to other small fry|ham

A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|this seems to be an improved version of the original kenner toys from the s however considering the other luke action figures with pilot outfit this is below average for a variety of reasonsthis action figure is nicely sculpted and the face shows a very young luke very nicely done by the way exceeded my expectations and it is above average as it should be however the helmet was poorly painted so the helmet glass was partially painted so when you put the helmet on it does not look right the left arm is extended too far to the left which is good to grab the helmet but not so good to insert the action figure inside a cockpit hand pose looks nicely sculpted as the sculptor knows about hand expression but the problem is that hand poses would be better for a female so it adds a weird feeling it comes with a base if you want to put it with other action figures in your galleryhowever as it seems to be a very old version of the action figure it lacks the rubber strips in the legs which are sculpted unlike more recent luke pilot versions also it does not have any ball joints and elbows and knees are not articulated so as a revamp of the s luke pilot it is outstanding and improved without the horribly painted helmet helmet painting would be very nice if the visor was not so small and it was not partially painted which is a defect of manufacture method design not sculptingbut if you compare it with more recent action figures it is below average as an overall product due to lack of poseabilityi can appreciate how good the sculptor is the face is very well done and this is something that i consider remarkable i would hire this guy if i had a toy factoryface detail goodoverall body detail goodfabric clothes naaccesories helmetmovie accuracy goodissues ugly helmetbenchmarking below average compared to other luke pilot action figuresposeabilityshoulder articulation standardelbow articulation nohip articulation standardknees articulation nofeet articulation nonotice i use this nomenclature for articulationsno it has no articulationstandard rotates around a single axis provides limited poseabilityball provides the best poseability|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the design for the female tusken raider is obviously taken from the idea of a muslim burqa ive never been crazy about that as a concept because it seems a bit too close to the st century middle east rather than a galaxy far far away nonetheless this figure is pretty well done admittedly it has almost no points of articulation but i cant imagine how you would want to pose it anyway the child tusken is a nice bonus i just wish there was a way to remove the backpack from the female because without the child in it the backpack looks ridiculous|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure of course lacks almost any articulation but nonetheless still holds up even after all these years the sculpt and paint job are all of high caliber and you can pose his arms in enough ways to make him gesticulate as if giving a senate speech while id love to see some of the senate figures updated this one will probably endure well enough for several more years|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i missed the boat during palisades run of the muppets figures which is super unfortunate for two reasons one i couldve bought them up as they were released supporting a great company that put out some of the best figures ever and two it wouldve meant that i wouldnt potentially spend hundreds of dollars on a small handful of figures fortunately you can score a deal every now and then so i may be catching up with the line in the future i recently got the mega muppets beaker for someone as a present last month and this was my first time getting to see a palisades muppet figure up close it really is astonishing how perfectly sculpted the figure is right down to getting that foamlike texture on beakers flesh there were only a few mega muppets released animal beaker gonzo and camilla and it seems that beaker is the most popular of the group since palisades went out of business before they could make more most collectors focus on the regular sized muppet figures and the mega ones dont go for super high prices still id recommend getting one now while theyre not too scarcebeaker stands at  inches tall and looks phenomenal the dude might creep me out with his design but it looks like they shrank down the puppet and made it plastic this is the best looking beaker collectible ive seen judging by pictures of the normal sized beaker figure that came with the muppet labs playset it looks like they just took the exact mold for that one and made it bigger everything looks the same beaker has articulated shoulders elbows hands legs and feet and his head can be turned a little bit to either side i was surprised by the joints in the shoulders allowing you to move his arms outward not just up and down this allows for some very fun poses the paint work on beaker is top notch as well from the striped socks to the tartan pants and his shirt under the lab coat everything looks perfect i dont have a single complaint about how this figure looks and this is coming from someone whos creeped out by this muppet the lab coat on his body is even made of rubber giving it a better feeling than if it were solid plasticthe only thing that wouldve made this toy even better is if they had included an accessory or two beaker doesnt come with anything gonzo had his bugle and animal had his drumsticks but this poor guy doesnt have a thing oh well you can take a lot of household things and put them in his hands and itll make for a great display beakers freaky face goes with just about anythingseriously how did this company go out of business you rarely see such love put into mass market toys these days neca does terrible with paint and quality control yet theyre snatching up licenses left and right if you havent bought a muppet figure from palisdes before youre in for quite a treat all we can do is hope that someone gets the muppets line again and puts even half as much care into the toys as palisades did i dont mean to worship the company but my god did they knock one out of the park with this|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter always likes the bad guys bowser from the mario games any villain from animated disney movies the sinister ghosts in ghostbusters you name it and between gizmo and the bad gremins who does she like the best thats right ol stripe here she even has a stuffed stripe that she adores so as soon as i saw gremlins figures got rereleased meaning no more stupidly high prices i bought him for her and now what theyre getting a little hard to find now i wish i had bought one for myself too this guys cool and comes with some good accessoriesstripe looks just like he does in the movie complete with a fuzzy mohawk the sculpt is fantastic as usual neca excels at making figures of creatures more than they do the humans they did a good job hiding most of the points of articulation too every bump crease wrinkle and scale on him looks perfect and the paints almost as good i just think the colors should be a little darker especially the markings on the back but still he looks great and i love the soft mohawk that he has i was expecting it to be sculpted with the rest of his head for articulation hes got more than gizmo headneck shoulders elbows wrists and thighs and itll take a little adjusting but he can stand up on his own just fine however be careful when moving his legs as the points on his tail are pretty sharp and could easily cut someone if they moved the legs too fast and got their hand stuck against the tailhe also comes with some nice looking extras popcorn various candy bars and a saw blade all of the food items look good for their size and he can hold some of them easily while the saw blade is easily the more fun of the accessories everything here is much better than poor gizmos  fuzz balls and d glasses i just wish stripe wouldve come with the gun he had at the end of the movieoverall this is a great figure for fans of the movie or fans of mischievous creatures i still prefer the mohawk figure over stripe but kids and adults alike will have fun with this dude|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i have to admit while i did want to get the gizmo head knocker as soon as i found out about it it just looked boring in pictures from what you see here doesnt it look identical to necas smaller figure i figured that this guy wouldnt be a favorite in my collection and hed probably be smaller to be more inscale with stripe but as soon as i opened the shipping box and saw this sucker i said oh my god out loud gizmo is huge he dwarfs several of my other head knockers and is nearly the same size as stripe whos one of my bigger ones the overall design is still bland but this is still a very cool piece to have if you didnt bother with the figuregizmo stands at around  inches tall and is sculpted well the fur on his body and head looks great and they got the finer details in his ears perfectly too hes kind of smiling with that little open mouth expression on his face and the base looks like christmas wrapping paper and a ribbon the body is hollow and most of the weight is in the head so be careful when handling this guy because these ones tend to shatter when dropped from even the lowest height neca did a good job here and even if it does look just like the figure hes still cute and i cant help but smile when i see those big mogwai eyes the bobble feature is very good too and gizmo nods all over the place without clanking against the bodyas usual the only negative about a head knocker by neca is the paint its not as bad as some others i have but the eyes were messy as were the feet but theres not a whole lot of fine details that needed to be different colors so they didnt have a lot to screw up on surprised they got the tiny teeth perfectly thoughany bobblehead collector who loves gremlins should definitely pick gizmo up and stripe too if i could only have one between them stripe easily wins because of the detailed sculpt and better paint but gizmos no slouch i just wish he had a different pose or something to make him stand out a bit more if you can get this little guy for the original price or less go for it|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i got this version of asajj ventress to go with the new hasbro realistic versions of the clone wars ahsoka tano obiwan and anakin this figure doesnt have much articulation compared to modern figures but it still holds up ok despite the lack of knee articulation she stands up well the face is painted well and looks like a realistic asajj from the microseries i personally like the effect of the moulded plastic clothes more than frabric clothesi hope hasbro makes a realistic version of asajj soon but this figure will work in the meantime|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i think neca is spoiling me with their line of head knockers i only have  by them at the moment but each one i get outdoes the last first it was the stay puft marshmallow man then slimer and now stripe the gremlins franchise has gotten a lot of new merchandise in the last year or so is a third movie in the works with figures pullback cars a little board game and more but this head knocker is easily my favorite of the bunch that ive seen gremlins fans will be very happy with this dudestripe looks damn near identical to how he does in the movie aside from having a bigger head he translates to the bobblehead form perfectly and that menacing look on his face is there in all its glory hes holding a gingerbread cookie and standing in a puddle of water on the base ready to cause mischief the sculpt on this bobblehead is fantastic and the paint on mine was nearly perfect something i didnt expect from neca all the spots and marks on his body look good and i especially love the work on the ears in terms of looks theres nothing i can complain about and the bobble feature works great the neck peg isnt too long or too short and the spring is the right size so he bobbles like any good bobblehead shouldthe only tiny problem is the design of this guy stripes hunched over and since most of the weight is in the head theres a good chance hell tip over if you move his head up and down with a bit of pressure whenever i do it i usually have my other hand in front of him just in case he falls since he does a little hop whenever he nods you might want to keep him more in the back if hes on a shelf so he doesnt go tumbling down to his doom but get this my stripe did fall off my shelf probably about  feet or so straight down to the floor and he didnt break maybe it was just luck or maybe the resin hes made of is more durable than the sin city marv head knocker which broke when it dropped just a foot and a half onto soft carpet but there wasnt a single break on him no broken fingers or claws or ears nothing it was amazing and i still cant believe it to this dayif you like gremlins or just cute yet nasty little creatures i highly recommend this bobblehead well worth the standard price so get him before prices skyrocket like stay puft has|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|while i loved the stay puft marshmallow man bobblehead as soon as i got slimer in the mail he took the top spot in my collection i cant tell if it was the fact that i got a perfect one or just how great it was overall but either way this is one bobblehead collectors shouldnt miss out on trust me if youre a fan of bobbleheads or just ghostbusters in general this is one of the better collectibles out therefirst up the sculpt slimer looks exactly as he does in the stock picture they didnt screw up the design and tweak things for the production run and he looks just like he does in the movie every wrinkle roll of flab and wart on his caboose is here there are tons of little bumps all over him too so its not just a standard smooth skinned sculpt the expression on his face is great and i love the food on the base which fits in with his appearance in the movie this bobblehead actually looks better than any other slimer figurecollectible ive seen even the more recent figures thatve come out in the last couple of years the paint on mine believe it or not was perfect too where the stay puft one had messes of white and blue paint here and there slimer doesnt have a single problem i was really impressed by how well the colors were on him with some different shades of green on the body to help with texturethe bobble feature on him is great and he rocks around on the peg a lot before stopping he isnt positioned on it too high or too low and the spring is very sturdy i hate to knock on the stay puft again here but that one was in big danger of breaking but slimer wont have any problemsyeah i know im talking about this like its some kind of fine art piece but i feel like this bobblehead should be getting more attention they couldve easily charged double for this guy and people wouldve probably still bought it but running the price of your standard head knocker slimer is an absolute steal and id recommend getting him before stay puft if you have a choice between the two and can only get one at the moment hes that good|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive been on a bobblehead kick recently thanks to fallout  and while i dont like a lot of their work on action figures neca has a lot of very cool bobbleheads when i saw that stay puft got immortalized in bobbleform i hunted one down right away this is probably my favorite one i own so far and i can see why this guys going for  or  times the original price but theres one thing that keeps it from getting  stars and its the usual problem i have with necamr stay puft stands at about  tall and is made of the standard resin that most bobbleheads by neca are the sculpt is really good and hes got an evil little face here which is a nice change from the usual happy expression though i wouldve been fine with that one too hes molded in a walking pose crushing a few cars on the base its a cool stand and this is what i like to see rather than the basic empty bases that most other companies do stay puft even has a real ribbon on his hat but the one on his sailornapkinthing is part of the mold he isnt necessarily a bobblehead since his head doesnt rock but instead his body does while his legs stay put he works best rocking from side to side and goes for a while before coming to a halt really cool to see one of these go for so longso whats the problem if it looks so good the paint as soon as i got mine out of the box i thought that some fan with no paint experience had done the work neca usually ends up using too much paint on their figures killing the detail in the sculpts but here there were no clean lines blue paint from the sailor thing went into stay pufts chest white paint from his head was in the bottom of his hat etc its pretty ugly thats one thing against me though for waiting on buying this and getting it offline instead of getting one in a store when it came out when i couldve inspected them on the shelf before buying but from what ive seen a lot of these guys have bad paint even the one in the customer imagesone last thing i need to mention is that the spring and post inside stay pufts body that causes him to bobble is very long and theres a chance of him breaking at the post because of this just be careful that you dont rock him too hard and that you hold him by the base with one hand and support the back or front with the other when youre moving him off a shelf because he could probably break if you tilt him in one direction for more than a few secondseven with the poorly applied paint this is a great bobblehead for any collector or ghostbusters fan and as long as you look around for a good price you should be happy with the purchase now if only they made a janine bobblehead too|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|rg stood out for a lot of fans because it really harkens back to the oldschool scifi vision of droids it really looks like something out of flash gordon hasbro knew how excited collectors were about rg and made this figure to high standards the paint and sculpt really give the droid a rundown feel to it it looks like he was even banged up a few times in a jawa sandcrawler there are even subtle dents and chips in the paint on purpose not due to rough handling of the figure this is definitely a musthave for any tatooine diorama i only wish lucas had included a few rs in the prequels|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|i was a little surprised upon receiving this that only thomas james and percy were on both the fork and spoon our grandson would have liked it better if the whole steam team had been included those mentioned along with edward henry gordon toby and emily instead of the odd items that separate them  the handles of both fork and spoon are identical with a light blue railroad track running the length of the handle against a darker blue background the top has a yellow circle with a blue t in the center then comes thomas then a clock showing  why then james then a yellow circle with a blue bus in the center why then percy then a red circle with a blue  in the center  if they hadnt included the circles there wouldve been room for the whole steam team on each handle or else  members on the fork and  on the spoon  regardless our older grandson did look forward to using these at lunchtime when i babysat for him and our younger one is just starting to use them so theyre sturdy enough to have held up well for close to  years  the fork is   long and the spoon is just a hair shorter  the only other thing id point out is that the slope of the spoon is minimal so for a little one just beginning to use utensils instead of fingers its a little difficult to keep those peas on the spoon long enough to reach the mouth  overall for  this was an okay purchase|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i had several issues with this toy and wish i hadnt bought it  they are as follows and these are the same problems many other people have hadfirst of all this toy was horribly made  the jingle sticks in particular were rough on the handles  were these sanded down at all  i seriously doubt they were  i seriously feared splinters from them  i mean wood chips were all over in the box when we opened iti know this is a toy but the point should still be to foster a love of music in kids that play with it  that will not happen with these instruments  it is impossible to make any kind of real music with these  the xylophone is made of wood which is so soft that my child dented it the first day and all the notes it plays sound the same  the notes on the recorder are the same way  they are just screeches with no distinction between the notes  the rest of the instruments are just random wooden things meant for banging so you really cant mess them upthere are some good toy instruments out there but i really wouldnt want someone to think they had found them with this toy  this is definitely not worth even half as much as this costs|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its unfortunate that there hasnt been a better release of bespin lando since this  figure fortunately this guy has aged pretty well except for the swivel elbows hes got a good range of articulation the likeness does look a bit more tough or carl weatherslike than billy dee williams friendly lando that we all remember from the movie but its still a pretty close match while i hope theres a vintage version on its way soon if youre looking for a lando for your cloud city diorama this is your best bet|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|overall this is a beautiful figure i agree with the other reviewer that parts of the figure can be a pain but when you get it to pose the way you want to its simply beautiful i love the paint and sculpt job the cloth the wookie braids  easily the best of all the boba fetts and there are a lot of them here are a few other things id notefirst the jetpack sometimes is a bit loose but it is possible to push it in tight i actually found that pushing it in over a bit of the cloth helps secure it after doing that ive had no problemssecond the head is a bit of a pain to move but not too bad just remove the helmet before moving the head that way you dont bend the helmetthird he doesnt hold his rifle well with just one hand it looks like its pointing too high it is possible to pose him holding the rifle trigger with his right hand and the barrel with the left not only does this fit the figure but it looks pretty awesomethat said because of these issues id really only recommend this figure for collectors not kids hes great to pose but probably wouldnt last long in a year olds bedroom|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i had one of these as a kid but it wasnt as good  this one is better because it has plastic protecting the springs so no little fingers get pinched  i would not recommend anything like this for a child under  because it is kind of high off the ground but this is a lot of fun for kids who are big enough for it|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a great representation of admiral ozzel the imperial officer who learnt that coming out of hyperspace too early isnt a good career move moreover in my opinion its also perhaps the best representation of any imperial officer ever put out by hasbro rather than simply a smooth olivegreen uniform ozzels uniform actually has a texture that feels like cloth he has a decent amount of articulation for a  figure my only complaint is that he cant ever fully straighten his arm especially his left arm which is positioned at an acute angle its not a significant problem but would have been nice to have gotten a greater range of motion|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a decent bossk and much better than the earlier one however the newer one is a lot better with many points of articulation this guys stance is a bit awkward id really only recommend this one if you strongly dont like articulated figures or the inevitable seams that show up|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy wont last long  it is basically two plastic cones and a long slinkylike spring  this gets tangled up easily which makes the toy completely useless  ours only lasted about  days and i even made sure it got put away carefully|ham

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i was disappointed in this toy at first because it didnt sing any of the songs all the way through  i mean who wants an alphabet song that stops at p  my husband ended up figuring out how to turn it off demo and now it does the whole songs which is great and saves the toy from getting donated somewhere  it is now a great toy  its so cute fun and also educational  my daughter loves to hug it to hear it talk and also to hear all the songs  this toy is now a favorite in our house|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|playing with the standard playmobil figures today i zoned out and went down memory lane stopping by playmobil land to pay a visit i was thinking about how great all of it wasis with the exception of this truck stephanie is right on in her review the ladder constantly falls off at first it was just a few times it gradually got worse i also wanted to mention to not put these  vehicles in sand it is difficult to remove it from any internal parts thus some of our vehicles had trouble rolling after sand episodes it took awhile for them to recover but all did with the exception of this truck which sorta lost some of its zoom three stars due to ladder problem|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|while the mayor is my favorite nbc character oogie boogie is a close second voiced by ken page he had a memorable song had fun torturing people and had a unique demise he barely got any screen time aside from his song but he sure wasnt forgettable neca did another great job with the sculpt on this head knocker just as they did with the mayor but while i lucked out on the paint with mine the bobble feature is severely lacking this is now the third head knocker by them that i have that doesnt bobble at the head but instead at the waist and im beginning to see that this might just plain ruin the feature over time thanks to the weight of the top portion but for a cool display piece to put on your desk or shelf oogie looks greatlike i said the sculpt is spoton and as soon as i took oogie out of the box i was impressed hes not too fat not too tall and they nailed that mischievous expression on his face they also sculpted in a bunch of little dots on his body to give him that canvas look and it really adds to the design neca couldve been cheap and just left him smooth but they put in the extra bit of effort and get bonus points for that oogie boogie stands on a base that looks like part of his roulette wheel that he fought jack on with some spikes and part of a ghost face on it hes holding his lucky dice and theyre so small you cant expect fine details on them or anything but its cool that hes holding them and of course you cant forget the couple of bugs and worms set in his mouth again they couldve just left his mouth plain black with nothing in there but the bugs is a cool extra touchsadly he barely wobbles around the backleft portion of his caboose is super close to his left leg and when you tap oogie hell bobble once really good but then clank against the leg and itll render him still within a few seconds the spring doesnt sound too good either sounds like one on a wellused mattress maybe the lack of wobbling is from the majority of the weight being in oogies body and the rest just being his itty bitty legs and the base but i dont knowat least he looks good and the paint on mine was nearly perfect only the dice were messy and one tiny stray black mark from the eyes plus the demand for nbc head knockers that arent jack isnt very high so you can get this guy for a very good price if you look around overall im happy with him and will probably end up getting another since my daughter is constantly moving him down from my bobblehead shelf down to her booktoy shelf when im not home|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|first of all i want to clear up a flaw in the description of this toy on amazon  you dont get  different picture cards  what you get is  that are double sided  one side shows the picture with color for matching and the other shows the same picture blank so kids can make it however they want  im fine with this but i did think it was a little misleadingthe reason i gave this  stars instead of  is that the pictures arent laminated or anything  they are just card stock and they can get ripped while kids are putting them in the back of the board  my yearold already ruined one of ours and you cant buy replacements  putting them in is sort of tricky so i do it for my kids now so no more get ruinedi still think this is a wonderful toy though because it teaches color matching  it also gives kids a chance to use their imaginations and be creative so its a toy i would recommend|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|there are lots of engines but not so many cars for the thomas wooden railway sets  annie and clarabel were given to thomas at the same time he was given the branch line so they are old friends  annie and clarabel can be seen in the opening credits of most thomas episodes but in the more recent animated series they dont actually talk to thomas like they used to they used to give him good advicethomas gets very jealous if anyone else pulls annie and clarabel  in the great discovery for example thomas bad feelings about the new engine stanley start festering when he sees him pulling annie and clarabelbecause they are so visible in the thomas movies and series my  year old was so happy to get them  he has the thomas train table and always points to them on the side of the table saying annieandclarabel  we finally realized he thought they had one name together and it wasnt until he started playing with these that we were able to teach him that they each had a name  that says something about how they are never separated in thomaslandvery few cars in sodor have faces the troublesome trucks do as well  it gives my son the ability to play out conversations between thomas and his two beloved coaches  now that we have annie and clarabel our set feels completethese are the usual high quality wood that take a beating very well|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|because this has a completely open top my daughter only wants to put the shapes in there instead of the right holes  i also dont like that there are only  shapes when you can get sorters with a lot more  the ones with more shapes are obviously more educational  i wont deny that this toy is cute but it plays unnecessary music  i would honestly just buy a different sorter|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i wasnt sure what to expect with this figure of course she doesnt have much articulation and is basically a statue nonetheless hasbro did a great job painting her and capturing her likeness i love the subtle shades of blue on her cloak a must have for fans of star wars politics|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ok the idea of a cyclops in the mos eisley cantina is a bit odd but this figure does a good job of making myo seem like an alien that could really fit into the world of star wars the face has a lot of detail which is nice because in the movie myos face is covered by shadow i like the fact that his cup is half blue half white making it look like its actually filled with a drink another great alien for those cantina dioramas|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a pretty good rendition of the gotal from the cantina scene hes got a surprisingly bright color scheme but hes otherwise pretty one ugly goat since there were multiple gotals in the movie this guy is a musthave i absolutely love how he holds his glass of red juice so well  he looks like a classic bar patron my only criticism is the blaster  its very rubbery and looks a bit bent but then again the character in the movie didnt even have a blaster so it doesnt really bother meunfortunately he seems pretty expensive  i found mine for double the store price and the prices listed here are even higher hopefully you can find a few cheap ones and have a few milling around the bar|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure has a great amount of detail and the little nose tubes are a nice touch unfortunately there are a few problems with the construction and paint job at least with the one i got the left arm is a bit loose at the elbow theres a slight bit of hair that isnt painted right where it touches the forehead the biggest problem is the neck  it just doesnt match dannik jerrikos darker face making the neck stick out like a pink thumb its too bad because with a bit more care this could have been a great figure|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these are just repackaged versions of the  jawa figures theyre not bad but there are much better ones out there now hasbro basically put a joint right at their waistlines so they could sit however this makes the figures look pretty silly plus since when do jawas need to sit|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|of all the characters in the nightmare before christmas the mayors always been my favorite when i saw that they made a head knocker of him he quickly became one of my most wanted bobbleheads when i saw the stock picture he looked perfect no exaggerated features like many others in the head knockers line and he bobbled at the waist which is pretty cool hed fit right in with some hula dancers off someones dashboard unfortunately it looks like necas bad reputation for sloppy paint goes back to at least  when this was madefirst ill get the good out of the way this head knocker looks just like the mayor in fact its a little more accurate than a few of the more recent figures of him the big caboose tiny feet four fingers everythings right about him both of his faces are here too the happy face in front and worried face in back some people have said that you can spin the head around to display him as you wish but unfortunately this isnt the case hes stuck in the happy position im fine with that but it wouldve been a great feature to have the option he comes on a stone base with the podium and a book with blank pages and the hat is removable the mayor has a metal peg sticking out of the top of his head and you carefully put the hat in place if youve had experience with gentle giants star wars statues and busts that have lightsabers youll have no trouble with this from a distance this is a killer head knocker and one of the better nbc onesbut the paint nearly kills the joy for me the paint on the ol mayor here is almost as bad as my bobblehead of russell from up there are literally splatters of grey paint on his body almost as if someone was using water colors on him black from the jacket bleeds into the white shirt and the black lines that separate his teeth look drawn in with an ultra fine point sharpieand some go off and into his lips the fine lines on his swirled eye are bad as is the simple red x on the black widow tie how bad is it that the best paint on this whole thing belongs to the base he stands on the real kicker is that the worried face on the back of his head is decent but with all the action taking place in the front itd be kinda silly to display him with his back to everyone his hat is also something to watch out for its very thin and light and could be easily broken if you force it too much on the peg finally the bobble feature is a mixed bag the spring is positioned low and the back of his rear clanks against the legs not giving much motion after  wobblesi feel like im being generous in giving him  overall youd be better off with the jun planning mayor figure if you want a really good one to display but for bobblehead collectors this is all weve got youd think for collectibles celebrating the th anniversary of nbc they wouldve put a little more effort into this heres hoping my oogie boogie doesnt suffer from the same problems|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure is rather old and doesnt have the detail or articulation modern collectors demand still it really does capture the evil essence of emperor palpatine he doesnt have any feet the base is solid so its pretty easy to stand him up the cane is a nice accessory overall there are better versions of palpatine out there i likeemperor palpatine star wars legacy collection action figure accessories  build a droid piece but this one is great for dioramas|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|considering that this is still the most recent lobot figure were fortunate that this  version of everyones favorite cloud city cyborg was done well it doesnt have the type of modern articulation of more recent figures but the swivel arms provide a surprisingly good range of motion more importantly the face is very realistic lobots outfit looks a bit too blue in my opinion really a shade of egg blue but i guess even he has to change his clothes sometime i hope hasbro releases a vintage series version of this figure but if not this one can stand proudly in your collection|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|i bought this action figure to complete my collection of bespin action figures  lobot in the movie has a gray vest and the toy has a very slightly greenish color  but it does not bother me at all  in general terms it is very movie accurate except for the face that looks a bit like a young captain picard from uss enterprise as lobot face was bit wider and this action figure has a bit of a skinny face  it is the only weird detail that looks heavily not movie accurateit does not have lots of articulations  it is more or less articulated like the old vintage of the s except for the elboys that move sideways  it is not a bother as in the movie he did not move too much and his role was mostly to be there standing upit comes with some kind of hand held device a laptop and a stand which was unexpected to me|spam

A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|there are two versions of the cloud car pilot this is the better looking one for a variety of reasons but not very good for some other reasonsthe overall sculpting and outfit design and painting is far better than the other cloud car pilot  the face costume and helmet are nicely sculpted and better than the other cloud car pilot  it comes with a gun and a comms device in its handit also has a holster very nicely sculpted that is not attached to the leg so it remains vertical when you try to sit it down  it is very inconvenient if you plan to make it sit down inside a cloud car  whoever designed the action figure never thought it should fit inside the shipso as an overall product i like this action figure very much except for the holster problem and i still prefer this one over the other cloud car pilot  i got to have the other cloud car pilot before my eyes in a store and the face sculpting was not very nice and it looks horrible  the moustache of the other cloud car pilot did not appeal to me eitheri am very pleased with this action figure  the only problem i see in it is the holster  but a holster problem is not enough reason to go for the other poorly sculpted version of cloud car pilot with a moustacheon a side note i may want to comment on the horrible habit of star wars designers that are adding moustache to soldier action figures  an eccentric moustache is something that could fit if you are salvador dali or a th century general or an th century rich man or a soldier from india or an eccentric british wwi pilot  however action figures moustach is not stylish and eccentric but ordinary which gives the impression of a soldier that does not shave  in my opinion a moustache not only is not decorative in this case as it is inappropriate for the context of a soldier or pilot but also it is not movie accurate so it reduces the value of the action figure as collectibleface detail excellentoverall body detail excellentfabric clothes naaccesories gun and walkie talkiemovie accuracy excellentissues removable holster prevents to sit correctly  with holster removed legs are shorter than seatbenchmarking better than the other cloud car pilotposeabilityshoulder articulation standardelbow articulation nohip articulation standardknees articulation nofeet articulation nonotice i use this nomenclature for articulationsno it has no articulationstandard rotates around a single axis provides limited poseabilityball provides the best poseability|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|ok i know that people are complaining about the fact that instead of finding out who committed murder one you have to find out who ate a piece of cake at a certain time with a certain beverage these babyish details have not derailed the fun for either my daughter or me as a matter of fact i chose this version at a thrift store as opposed to another clue jr version at the same thrift store that seemed even more babyish due to dopey lookin kids searching for a mutt or something akin to that the game does not seem too difficult nor too simple i think that this game could possibly be too above a fiveyearolds head but from sixish on would be great fun after placing donotpeek time and beverage bases in the center of the board in order to establish the crime scene you place cardboard characters in the white time bases and furniture pieces in the yellow drink bases including the crumb evidence base which a character resides on all these aforementioned pieces are placed in certain rooms on the board play begins by rolling the die if you roll to the yellow side of the die you can look under any piece of furniture if you roll white you may peek under any character if you roll a number of spaces you can move any character in a certain direction in order to get to the info you desire in order to win the game that much quicker you can try to land on yellow footprints within a room in order to peek under the piece of furniture within that room you can land on white footprints within a room to look under a character or you can just try your best to go in an intended direction towards rooms and people that you have not checked out yet it just adds a little more strategic action to the game and a little more excitement of course you must check off the times drinks rooms and people that you have investigated in order to deduce who is the cakesnatcher if the rules seem too confusing or complicated just tweak them fun is not always achieved by rules set in stone our pieces are not top heavy and we do not really knock them over during gameplay i do not feel that this game is cheaply made it is just standard briarpatch or ravensburger games seem no tougher than this game i do not care that pencils were not included as i have pencils in my home my daughter and i have great fun figuring out the culprit etcwe get to feel like sherlock holmes for a minute just without a pipe or scotland yard detectives getting in the way|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|weekend in new england is a fashiononly set from the barbie fashion model collection  this clothing is intended for the bfmc dolls only since those dolls tend to be slimmer in the waist than traditional vinyl dollsthe sets inspiration is a summer weekend at antique auctions in new england  the set comes with a  piece chinese silk patterned skirt set for barbie and a beige  piece suitshoes for ken  all the clothing items are highly detailed and of the highest quality  including lining and bfmc labeling  the set also comes with accessories such as bidding paddles purse etcits a decent set and you get a for value since you can match up barbie with ken  the only detractor for me is that the suit set for barbie though of high quality feel kind of slim would have liked more detailing or just more fabric to it|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the quarren is really one of the more distinguishable denizens of jabbas palace tessek is one of the few background characters i remember distinctly i had the old s figure but this one blows that away this tessek is very faithful to the movie version its interesting because the flowing cape and robe probably give him more of a regal air than his character deserves that said id love to see an updated version of this guy|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this mon calamari figure still looks great after all these years the paint job on the head is quite good this officers chest is a bit large for the character reflecting hasbros desire to give all of its characters a macho demeanor but its not too bad i like the helmet as an additional touch if you like mon cals id also recommend the newstar wars  vintage collection action figure admiral ackbar|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember getting this dewback when it first came out its a pretty decent creature even though the head is disproportionately large its skin really feels scaly and reptilian this was certainly the best star wars creature at the time the sandtrooper fits in the saddle easily theres now a new dewback the star wars the legacy collection dewback with imperial sandtrooper exclusive figure setwhich is even better but a bit more expensive i like to think of them as different subspecies or a male and female|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|the viper probe droid is nicely modelled  the only aspect that i do not like are these orange parts that makes it look a bit like a toy for small children but thats me  you may see the pictures i included for this product to see its functionality|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|this dewback the creature is very sturdy and nicely detailed  it really does not bother me that the head is large indeed i in the original movie it was just like that  i would have given five stars if it was just the creature legs move forward and back tail moves sideways and when it does it raises the head and opens its mouth quite a nice detailthis dewback comes with a stormtrooper that is really ugly not movie accurate at all  this is why it has one less starit comes with a backpack a rifle that you attach to the backpack and a spear  it was poorly designed as it has problems to grab the spear and also it cant seat properly on the creature  as i tried to sit it the action figure fell th the floor and the rifle attached to the backpack was broken in three pieces as probably the action figure fell in such a way that it revealed the failure in design  the points of fracture were the pin that is used to attach the rifle to the backpack and the rear part of the riflepoor design led to such damage just after it was out of the box  this is why it has another less star making it a  star producthowever this design flaw did not become frustration as i had the most recent vintage sandtrooper that comes with a flying droid and orange cover over the shoulder and he fits perfectly  the sandtrooper that came with it is somewhere in a closet to scare kids in halloween too ugly for my tasteso you have a beautiful reptile creature with an ugly action figure that is completely disposable let alone fragile and unfit for the creature|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the hammerhead ithorians and this is a decent figure however theres a much better version of momaw nadon that was released more recently you can find him atstar wars  the saga collection  basic figure  momaw nadon by contrast this figure is a bit stiffer and looks drab brown and that gun ithorians are supposed to be peace lovers bottom line get the newer version|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|first of all this is a perfectly respectable figure of bossk unlike some of the earlier star wars figures he doesnt suffer from extreme machoism however id recommend the newer versions particularly because they have more articulation and have open mouths think about it  bossk with an open mouth|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this version of lom is a bit too big for the actual character who is rather short the orange markings  which seem to indicate rust but arent actually on the character in the movie even so the figure is still pretty detailed and worth getting as an extra droid for the definitive version of lom however id recommendstar wars  vintage collection action figure lom|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|but theres now a brand newadmiral ackbar return of the jedi black and silver vintage action figure this figure is the  version one of the earliest star wars figures it was great for its time and he has a good sculpt but in retrospect the design is a bit cartoonish the head is a bit too horizontal for a mon calamari and his chest is puffed out in the hero pose that hasbro was so fond of in the mids the newer vintage version is a lot more accurate still i have very fond memories of this version of ackbar i have two of them and definitely recommend it as a generic mon calamari officer for dioramas|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|nien nunb is probably the most important character from the original trilogy that hasnt yet received an updated since the potf line this figure wasnt bad for the time and still hold up decently however it has minimal articulation and the color tones for his sullastan face are a bit off the buildadroid wave   bwing pilot nien nunbfigure shows how much better hasbro can make sullastans nowadays itd be great to see a nien nunb in his smugglers gear come out next year in the vintage line|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a nice figure of leia from the dark empire comics the red color scheme might look odd but accurately represents how she looked in the comics this isnt a particularly unique leia and basically looks like any other leia with a dark cape and red lightsaber the pose is stiff as shes just standing not fighting nonetheless hasbro probably wont make another dark empire leia ever so this is it an added bonus is the small diorama background that comes with the figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this version of the spacetrooper has held up surprisingly well its large stature is impressive and it has a wide range of mobility for a potf figure however there is a newer version thats a lot bigger and has more articulation you can check it out at star wars  saga legends action figure sl no  spacetrooper|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this jabba is based on the version in the original special edition of a new hope that version looked pretty pathetic as if jabba had lost  pounds and is in fact no longer considered cannon likewise this toy version isnt the greatest jabba only looks forward and cant recline on his side as in return of the jedi the skin is hard plastic not the soft leathery feel of later versions if you want a jabba i highly recommend the new  version|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|overall this is a great rendition of general crix madine its difficult to portray stubble in an action figure but i think this figure does a good job my only complaint is the elbows  they are articulated but for some reason dont look realistic even when positioned straight the elbows look too much like joints and not enough like elbows also madine doesnt hold the pointer as one would hold a pointer as his hands seem better suited to a blaster overall certainly not bad for a first run at madine|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i believe that the crane we bought is different from the crane that the other reviewers said fell apart this crane came with four pieces to assemble  the top of the crane two pieces that make the tower and the base assembly was easy  four screws  and my  year old even helpedonce we were done with that assembly we started playing immediately my son worked the two black knobs on the top to raise and lower the claw and then to move it towards and away from the tower it is a very simple and easy to use setuphe also moved the little person into the elevator on the side of the tower and moved him up and down he then put the little person in the driver chair next he moved the crane top in a circular motion he had a lot of fun discovering how it workedthe last thing we did was try out the claw he had a little bit of a challenge pulling back the black ball to make the claw open he tried picking up his wooden thomas but that was too heavy so then we took the man out of the elevator and he picked that up with the claw it picked that up just fine but anything much bigger or heavier we havent had success with so i told him that this crane which we put in with his thomas wooden set was there to load lumber and coal into the thomas cars it works great for thatit really is nice  im a huge fan of wooden toys my  year old likes playing with it and thats what is important he just gets a little frustrated with the claw|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my  year old and i really enjoy playing this game together  its fun has the right mix of thought adding card points strategy appropriate for an  year old whether to steal or not a queen and fun cards are beautifully illustrated and very sillythe play is very straightforward  there are  sleeping queens and you awaken them with a king card  but knights can steal an awakened queen dragons can defeat nights potions can put an awakened queen to sleep and a wand can stop a potion  queens have points  get enough points and you win  in addition to keep the game moving there are numbered cards that have their own way of being played to help you draw more cards each turnin all  highly recommended  we love it|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|of course this figure is primarily for collectors and its a good one at that it has a good paint job and likeness of general dodonna not a lot of articulation compared to todays figures but a decent amount and the arms can twist at the elbows its not the most amazing figure  nothing here is going to wow you  but certainly worth getting for fans ofstar wars episode iv  a new hope|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|its arms are not very poseable the outfit prevents legs from moving one star lessfeet are bent sideways so it cant stand up on a flat surface on its own so it needs the stand to stay up  stars less one for each bent footso in the end it is more like a statue for hardcore collectors it may be just fine in terms of nostalgia but it is not a great action figure more like a small statue face detail is good|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this isnt a bad figure set given that its already  years old or so in fact the dooku and darth maul are probably the best versions of those  figures weve had to date although the vintage style maul should be a vast update while the sidious figure isnt nearly as good as the vintage one its definitely a workable alternative if you cant find the vintage one or want more for dioramas you can make dooku or sidious shoot lightning from their hands with the replaceable hands this effect actually looks pretty good and is surely better than putting holes in the figures hands the old method overall these figures could use an update but theyre still not bad if you need extras of these characters or want to use the parts for customs|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|when the movie maniacs line first hit stores they were an instant hit freddy jason and leatherfacethree of the biggest names in horror movies the figures looked great came with a good number of accessories and were available in bloody and clean versions back then in  i saw the texas chainsaw massacre for the first time and leatherface was my movie killer of choice he was just so cool freaking out over all these kids coming into his house wondering where they came from and taking them out quickly and efficiently so of course i made it my goal to get the mm figure of him it took a few months but when i got him i was not disappointed now though  years later weve gotten many other leatherface figures from other companies but you know what i still prefer this one at least in this scale theres just two little problems keeping it from being perfectleatherface was probably the best equipped of the first three mm figures he came with a severed head severed arm hammer bucket chainsaw and minimovie poster its said that the severed head is that of todd mcfarlane so that adds some extra cool to this figure right there mcfarlane didnt skimp out on detail or gore with these accessories as you can see the veins arteries bones in the stump of the neck and the same applies for the severed arm both can fit in the bucket but its only big enough for one or the other personally i always displayed the arm sticking out of the bucket with the head laying at leatherfaces feet the hammer looks nice took and can be held in either hand though you might have to position it differently a few times since the handles so small and it falls out easily the chainsaw is huge much bigger than the one leatherface uses in the movie one of my two problems with this figure and he can hold it in one or both hands like the hammer bucket and body parts and leatherface himself its splattered in blood fun fact its rumored that the blood for these mm figures was actually real animal blood finally the little poster is held in place by a pretty cool frame made up of bones and skulls looks good behind and to the side of mr leatherfaceleatherface himself has decent articulation but mcfarlane figures were never known for their articulation until the halo line his arms move up and down and you can move his arms at the elbow a little but thats about it he also turns at the waist but the apron gets in the way and youll risk breaking it if you try to turn him all the way around his head also moves a little but i didnt get mine to move much the sculpt on leatherface is excellent and i would admire this figure all the time when i first had it but looking at it now this aint leatherface you can even see the difference between the figures head sculpt and the image from the movie on the package just whose face is he wearing here also this iteration of leatherface is in pretty good shape not the bulky force that we see in the movie its a minor gripe but with them getting freddy jason and the other mm figures perfectly i wonder why they messed up on the body type and face hereall in all this movie maniac leatherface will make a great addition to your collection i recommend getting the bloody version since it looks better but if you want to customize a clean one and splatter it up yourself go for it but if you want the ultimate leatherface go for mcfarlanes own  inch leatherface that thing is perfect and looks even better than sideshows own premium format figure that cost x as much|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|sora bulq is one of the critical characters in the clone wars comics so its great to finally get a figure of him dont worry even though this figure is over  years old he still holds up well hasbro did a great job with the articulation and paint what really impresses me is the hair its a soft plastic and flexible simulating realistic hair the only major problem is that he lacks knee articulation but hes preposed in a dramatic pose that looks great as if hes got forward momentum definitely recommended|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i used to love the original momaw nadon figure however this one is a lot better the paint job and sculpting are very realistic he comes with a glass and a staff which are more realistic items than the doublebarreled gun from the original figure i highly recommend this figure if youre a fan of the ithorians|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|one thing i appreciated about the tartakovsky clone wars was its bold visual images one of the coolest images was that of the talz jedi whod have thought wed ever see one of those much less get a figure of him one of the most exotic looking jedi everhasbro made the character in realistic style so he looks fine next to the regular star wars figures yes its a retool of muftak the talz from the cantina yes it would have been great if hasbro had added more articulation particularly at the elbows but you know what it works this figure looks awesome the clothes and boots are fully removable which both makes them look more realistic and allows you to use this figure as a generic talzone problem some might find is that the lightsaber handle is too small for foul modama to hold onto tightly he simply wont hold it i found that switching it with his best friendroron corobbslightsaber which has a thicker handle works well and moudamas lightsaber looks great in corobbs hands this is something hasbro should have fixed but certainly doesnt doom the figure if youre willing to pull a switch besides moudama and corobb are buddies and need to be togetheroverall a nice tribute to tartakovskys series|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|now that im getting into the play arts figures thanks to red xiii i went and picked up auron since he was one of my  favorite characters from final fantasy x and the coolest of the  figures they made from the game while the figure came out a few years ago hes not that hard to get for a decent price but theres a very good reason for that which ill get to in a minute basically when it comes to auron collectibles you dont have many options theres this figure the  scale kotobukiya statue andtiny bottle cap figures and keychains thats about it the  scale statue looked great but had very limited articulation and now goes for an insanely high amount of money oh how i wish id bought it the one time i saw it in a store for the original price this smaller figure to me looks better than the statue but has some very big problems that keep it from being a real musthavefirst the good this is a fantastic sculpt of the legendary guardian the face is deadon his outfit looks fantastic and most of the details on his robe are there from the beads to the little ring thingies for one of the first play arts figures that was released im impressed auron really does look better when youve got him right in front of you than he does in the stock pictures the articulation for aurons standard look is good too you can move his head around right shoulder right elbow right wrist waist right above the belt upper legs knees ankles and feet out of the box auron comes in his signature look with his left arm tucked in his kimono this arm has no articulation and cant be moved at all because its a sculpted piece that can be removed to switch out with a normal left arm and the sleeve off his shoulder i love this feature on paper since it gives another display option for the figure in addition to the left arm and sleeve attachment is aurons sword the sword looks perfect and fits perfectly in his hand its also worth mentioning that the bottom part of his kimono is made of a soft rubbery plastic that makes bending the legs much easier great design choiceso while he might look good the problems kick in as soon as you try to work that tucked left hand out of the body ive read enough horror stories from other people who own the figure and it seems like everyones broken this piece ive tried to remove the tucked arm many times since removing auron from the box and its tighter than a nun there were even instructions included in the box that tell you how to remove and insert the pieces but they dont help much especially when its mentioned that if the fit is too tight that you could break something i havent had any success in changing the arms and at this rate i think im better off not doing so as cool as auron would look with his left arm out ready to bring the pain i dont feel like being yet another person with a busted auron also it seems like the right arm on my figure has a little problem with the shoulder joint not being able to swing the arm outward the joint actually moves up and down appearing to be loose and the part that should be moving the arm out wont budge ughon top of these problems the handle on the sword breaks off very easily how easily well it lasted for all of  minutes once i took it out of the plastic tray hows that sound fortunately its nothing that some good glue cant fix but come on it would seem that something has to break on this figure for everyone if its not the arm its either the sword or glassesminor nitpicks of mine which arent big since this was one of the first play arts figures and quality has since gotten better are that his glasses arent accurate to how they were in the game and two key features on the head are missing one being aurons ponytail and the other being his stubble the glasses thing is understandable given the small size but it wouldve been nice for them to add that extra detail of stubble around his mouth and cheeks and given him his ponytail oh and some different colors on his hair wouldve been great too with white streaks here and there but again these are just minor things that i notice overall the figure looks incredible on my shelf and im glad i have itif you collect the play arts figures auron is a solid addition but be very cautious when handling him it just sucks that the figure is so fragile everyone whos pointed out something breaking isnt over exaggerating he really does break that easily as long as you dont overpay you should be happy with the figure i cant help but wonder how much better hed be if they had waited until now to make him though auron getting the same treatment as the metal gear solid figures good god|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|first the obligatory how to fix this loud toy thing just put some scotch tape over the speaker bam problem solved otherwise this is a fantastic music toy for any child that loves the backyardigans or just loves grooving to music whats really great about this toy is that the songs are all from the show not some generic songs or something that sounds like it belongs in another show youre getting  different styles of music here each one having two different tracks and each one tells you what style of music youre listening to i marked the educational value rating up a little just for this because most music toys dont say what style it is or make an effort to set them apart each track plays for a good amount of time not too long to the point where itll drive you crazytheres also a microphone that barely works it has to be pretty much right against your mouth to pick up anything and more than likely itll sound fuzzy when it comes out of the speaker its kind of an addon feature to this toy since its mostly a toy stereo and has  different songs but i guess its something extra your kids can play withthe music maker also get some crazy battery life even on the ones that come with it we didnt have to change the batteries for over  months and my daughter played with this sucker on a regular basis and if you have kids that love to throw or drop everything the music maker can handle damage without a problem ours got smashed by heavy toys and kept playing just fineof all the music toys ive seen over the last  years this one still seems to be the best for your buck provided you get it at around what it originally cost there are a ton of toys like this that play the music until you physically turn it off and its just one track looped over and over luckily this isnt one of those if youre looking for a good music toy with a good shelf life look no further than this little beauty|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this set has some decent figures but the real draw is the large chameleon droids unfortunately the legs break quite easily im not a kid im an adult collector but even so i found the plastic snapped very easily even under mild pressure regardless its a decent buy for clone wars fans if you can find it for a cheap price|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this looks like it would be a blast for kids but it isnt  first of all the age requirement is a joke  it says  months but there is no way a yearold could ride this thing  it is really smallanother problem is that it doesnt bounce much at all and is very difficult to spin  bouncing on this thing would give me a headache  i dont know about little kids but mine didnt like it at all  this was such a waste of money and space in my house|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i dont like plain ring stackers but this one is so much more than that  each ring has a different sound texture or activity  one has a bead that spins and there are rattles and textures to explore as well  my baby also likes to hit the giraffes to make them pop up and down  i think this is a great option if youre looking for an interesting stacker like i was|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this tiger is one of the amazing animals that my kids have  they love to moves its legs in different ways and rotate its head  they also love the textures on its feet  the purring sound its supposed to make is barely audible but my kids dont care about that because they make the noises for it on their own|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|my kids have this along with other amazing animals and like it a lot  it squeaks when you close the mouth and you can manipulate the legs and tail in different ways to hear a clicking sound  my baby loves this sound especially  this toy is also very sturdy|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|in my defense this monstrosity entered my abode recently with other lps sets that i actually coveted and won on ebay in my bidding fervor i didnt even notice this above set included in the lot if i had i would have had a crucifix readied at my front door certainly works wellyou can hear the cat slurping from the bottle rooms away cat is placed on metal rod on heavy batteryoperated basket magnetic bottle is placed to cats piehole and the resultwell lets just say that i am reminded of the guy that rizzo takes to the school dance instead of kenickie in the movie grease|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i liked that these pieces were sturdy heavy and thick wood  i do wish that they were painted on both sides  when i opened this there was fine wood dust on everything|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i love these and use them to teach my daughter about basic math and also about patterning  she loves to make different patterns and sort them by color as well  they are bigger than scrabble tiles in case anyone was wondering about the size but they seem to be the same kind of plastic  they also come in a reusable jar and i was really glad about that|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|these pegs are great for patterning and recognizing colors  i like that they are easy to stack and stay put without jiggling around in the holes like others i have seen  you can also buy more pegs separately if you want which is great for families with more kids|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|nicely packaged great playability and a storage case for those loose small toys that seem to end up everywhere and so dont get played with often  my  year old loves it  takes them out plays scenes from the movies then puts them away in the tin and on the shelf|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this set is great for building and stacking  i think it will be great for problem solving as well because my kids will have to figure out how to position both the pegs and shape platforms so they work  i do wish the shapes were thicker but that doesnt take away from the value of the toy|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|the shapes are thinner than they looked in the picture and they all dont go all the way down on the bar  you can still complete the patterns provided but my daughter cant make her own because some of the pieces get stuck halfway down  this is a wonderful concept for a toy but poorly executed|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|thereve been a few smaller pablo plushes released over the years but this one still seems to be the best it looks just like him isnt overstuffed and has a happy expression on his face the colors are right and hes very cuddly my daughter would always hold him when she was a baby so it gets child approval and hey the price for this guy is very good so it wont be hurting your walletbut theres one thing to watch out for and the main reason this doesnt get  stars in the durability category from me the propeller can split in half and could be something your child gets in their mouth if it comes off i dont think anyone could choke on it since its so small but just keep an eye on the propeller and make sure its still in one piece every now and thenif your child loves the backyardigans pablo in particular this would be a great gift for them maybe theyll find the flying rock together|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we purchased this used on the big auction site for cheap there are lots available under twenty bucks and were surprised at how interesting this game ended up beingbe prepared before you start  there is set up necessary that takes a bit of time  you dont really need the d elements such as the traps and backdrop though  so if you want to avoid them dont worry  and the instructions are well written and easy to understand for both set up and playingthe game is different depending on how many players you have  overall you want to be the person who survives long enough to inherit aunt agathas wealth  there are  or so characters and everyone can move them  toward inheriting the fortune or toward traps that will knock them off  and take them out of the game  each player secretly has  characters that they are trying to move to inherit  and since no one knows who has which characters there is a lot of bluffing going on as players try to move their characters to the finishexit of the mansion while also moving characters they dont have toward traps to be knocked off  there is also a detective closing in  when he arrives at the front door the game is over and the favorite player whose card is showing over the fireplace wins  so there are several ways to win  knock out every one else get your secret player to the exit while your character is showing as the favored and to be favored when the detective arrivesyou dont need the set pieces to play but you do need to have all the cards  sets all the character tokens and  dice  keep that in mind if you buy this set used|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i got this set for the exclusive senate pod its a great diorama piece for all of the senator figures in the star wars line i got a few for my chancellor palpatine bail organa and orn free taa the clone troopers are pretty well done and while there are better versions they hold up surprisingly well when compared to modern figures however the sidious and yoda are pretty obsolete yodas not a horrible figure but lacks the detail and cloth cloak of the vintage version sidious is basically a stiff statue its actually not a bad rotj emperor figure given that we dont have a modern version but it lacks all but the most basic articulation also the blue lightning coming out of his sleeve is pretty silly overall the senate pod is the highlight of this set|spam
AETU6WZAUMX53|the color and detail of both wrestlers are firstrate a good reminder of their many matches they had against each other back in wcw and in tna wrestling the package itself is easy to tear apart becuase theres no strings holding them at the back of the box like other ones buy it if you are a fan of sting andor jeff jarrett i give this  pack a  out of |spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is obviously a set for collectors its neat to have all of the lucas figures in one collection however i certainly wouldnt pay the price listed on amazon you can probably find it used on ebay for a third of the price i did the figures themselves are generally well painted but the faces lack any emotion or depth george lucas character a baron who supposedly has information networks that rival the bothans stares somewhat blankly jett lucas neck is a bit too thin and narrow the chi eekway figure is pretty good anyway this set one is probably one youll keep in the box|spam

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|back in the early eighties i was a real big fan of the superfriends cartoon at one point i tried to paint the front of our doublewide trailer to look like the hall of justice long story short my parents were pretty mad and my tv privileges were reduced to six hours a day for a monthmy punishment would of been longer but my dad was arrested at his job at radio shack for stealing cordless home phones with a twentyfive foot range as a result he missed my fifteenth birthday party that yearabout thirty days later i got the coolest birthday present any fifteen year old kid could hope for at school not only did i get a cordless phone but my dad came into my math class dressed up as hawkman he had spent his time in prison making a hawkman costume similar to what he could recall from the superfriends cartoon the costume was made from ramen noodle packages prison work jeans with colored boots and gloves the mask and wings bless his heart were composed of pillow feathers glued to cardboard cereal boxes cut in appropriate fiited shapes he used yellow yarn to make the wings sort of moveto this day hawkman will always hold a special place to my heartthough this figure is short on excessive body hair tattoos and a gut like only my dad has i think this figure is closest to the being the best hawkman figure out there|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i totally agree with the first two reviews here this is a good idea in need of more books i bought this for my niece in burma so she could learn english and she loves it unfortunately it seems the company behind this product no longer makes this unit and has stopped making books for it i hope they revive the book line soon  otherwise i cant recommend getting this unit|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this broke within a day  in fact the entire series of these playsets each broke within  days use  each in different ways  i cant believe disney puts out such bad quality products for such outrageous prices  this isnt worth any price to me|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i always regretted not having found these when they first came out in the late s i finally tracked them down for a reasonable price i like both ships the nostromo ship is actually pretty detailed for a toy of this size the detail really captures the industrial spirit of the ship from the movie the narcissus looks good as well although it could have used more weathering in the detailing the two figures are decent about the size of action fleet figures so if you have those aliens action fleet ships these figures are a nice addition but if you dont have the action fleet ships and those were rare then the figures are just kind of extra id have preferred another ship overall if you can track this down its a nice treat for alien fans|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the waitress is from the high end collector bfmc series  she is a silkstone  made of a vinyl plastic that is similar in weight and texture to porcelain  since she is in the bfmc series her clothing and accessories are of the highest quality  most bfmc dolls also have vintage facesthe waitress wears a thick crisply starched cotton pink uniform with tie on apron  a hat with clear plastic stays adorns her head and she comes with a thick clear plastic coffee pot  the uniform is beautifully made  the best feature of the doll reallythe one detractor reason it is  instead of  stars is that the hair is often quite a mess  mine arrived new but the front of the hair was all over her face and had to be restyled as a result  so with a little attention to detail she becomes a lovely display and a great addition to a bfmc collection|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|something different and interesting  and the packaging of the game set is just fantastic it makes a great display piece when you are donethe object of the game is to collect objects which you can use to cast a prank on someone  but there are also counter prank cards and other action cards that change how the game is playedyoull move around the neighborhoods collect the prank pieces use sewers to move quickly to various areas once a prank item you need gets revealed and various cards to hinder to obstruct your opponentthe pranks are cute pour a pile of worms on someone and cause him to lose a turn and the game is fun and not too mean spirited  the board is quite detailed and beautifully drawn  the token figures are beautifully detailed as well  its a very special unique and different game than you would expectin all high marks  ive played it with my  year old but i would recommend a bit older to be able to make full use of the strategy|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|my daughter loves this toy  she loves the spinning balls  she presses the button down over and over to watch them  other kids i know that have this toy are the same way  this is a toy that doesnt require batteries which is another plus in my book|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my  year old is just starting to get into sports and we thought this would be a good trainer for him  we had a bat and ball and were getting really tired of spending all our time running after the ball  the assembly on this was very simple  in fact it passed the i assembled it right without looking at the directions test  its simple plastic and you have to fill the base with water or sand it just goes flying when hit otherwiseeven after you fill it though the ball doesnt stand out from the pole after being hit  you can get it to do so but a hit or two makes it slack again  so my son can still hit it but almost every time ends up hitting the pole as well which we dont wanti think with some higher quality materials it might have been exactly what we wanted its still quite useful though and since it has two modes it will give us great tball practice|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|on its own this figure isnt great the head is too pale and the hair doesnt look like it parts righti used this figure for parts for a custom carth onasi figure i made it actually makes a great carth if you repaint the jacket orange i recommend using the kyle katarn for the head|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i used to love the older potf version of this figure when it first came out however that one had no articulation and could never stand this one is such a huge improvement the helmet is nice and shiny the figure as just about as much articulation as you could ask for the only complaint i have is that the knees look a bit too big from some angles but they look better if slightly bent definitely a good figure to build imperial forces for any death star diorama|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|check out the new vintage version of this figure at star wars  vintage collection action figure  senate guard its got actual fabric rather than plastic for the cape its definitely an upgrade over this figure|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|there were a few things that made me buy this toy  first of all i wanted a shape sorter that had a lot of different shapes instead of the  or  most have  this one has  so that was a definite plus for me  i also wanted a clock to teach telling time but i didnt really want it to be electronic with lights andor music because i dont think every toy on the planet has to have that  this toy fits all my needs perfectly  i would definitely recommend it to anyone|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily one of the best star wars vehicles hasbro has made yet of course its awesome as the only example of a true sith ship we ever see in the films however hasbro did a particularly good job i really appreciate the fact that hasbro did not sacrifice the design or dimensions of the ship just so it could fit a figure i hated how the old millennium falcon had a huge cockpit and relatively tiny hull by contrast this ship almost looks like a model and is a nearly perfect replica of the one from the moviehaving said that there is a hidden missile launcher when you pull open the hull i guess this is for kids but even when i was a kid i hated when hasbro added these types of features on vehicles fortunately if you keep the hull closed its fairly inconspicuous i just pretend it doesnt existi did see that other reviewers complained about the size of the ship all i have to say is get real hasbro is not going to make a huge version of this ship  the company knows not enough people would pay for it this ship is rare enough to find and costs a good deal secondhand i got mine off ebay for a reasonable price but many are sold for double what i paid so no the ship is not scale to the darth maul figure however as a fan of the old action fleet line it is scale to the action fleet figures thus you could just use it as a ship versus say the naboo starfighter or the droid fighters i dont even bother to put my darth maul figure in the cockpit which is basically just greyoverall definitely get this ship if you are a fan of star wars vehicles  or if you have fond memories of the action fleet line|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the basic choice with this figure is this do you prefer plastic or fabric clothes if the latter then the new star wars  vintagestyle carded darth sidious  foil carded variant is a much better option it has flowing cloth robes and an extremely detailed face this version is probably better if you prefer the plastic robes|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|who didnt love shaun of the dead well ok i can name a couple of people but nevermind that when figures from the movie were announced i was really excited and planned on getting them i lucked out and won this  talking shaun at a jesusmas party a couple of years ago it looked great and i proudly put him on top of my entertainment center as soon as i got homewell it does look great theres no denying who this is when you see the figure anyone whos seen the movie will know this is shaun it looks just like simon pegg and he has a serious look on his face like hes ready to take out some zombies hes holding the cricket bat in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other his arms can move up and down at the shoulder and he attaches to the base via a peg on it and a hole in his foot what i thought was really cool was the record box behind him and how it comes with records to put in it and it even opens and closes yep they did an outstanding job on the sculpt on this suckerunfortunately there are two problems one minor and one major the minor problem is that the paint work on shaun isnt that great and this was a common problem mine had a huge chip off the tip of his nose missing so there was this black spot on the end very distracting theres also a lot of bleeding and unclean work on the finer details like his eyes and hands but if you can see these in a store before buying and care about that you can check the figure yourself to make sure you get a good one the big thing i didnt like with this figure though was the talking feature yes thats shaun talking and not some other actor but the lines none of them are funny with all of the hilarious oneliners in the movie not a single one was given to this figure whats the point of giving freakin shaun a talking feature if hes going to say we need to get somewhere safe they really dropped the ball on this feature one final thing though is that over time shaun will begin to lean forward or back and youll probably need to tape his feet down because the figures pretty heavy and the base isnt solid enough to support itif you can get a figure with good paint bump up the rating to  stars but the stupid talking feature takes a star away no matter what it sucks when someone who loves the movie sees this pushes the button to make him talk has a smile on their face ready to laugh at something funny and goes through the couple of lines and gets nothing out of it it doesnt take away from how good the figure looks though and any fan of shaun of the dead should have this maybe theyll reissue the figure and give him at least one funny line|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the egg is rather cool  has a membrane on the outside  and the dinosaur lights up very nicely  but to light up the dinosauregg you need a small little part that is easy to lose  and we cant find the piece that connects the head to the jaw so the dragon just sits there broken and forlorn  he doesnt really fit back into the egg once hes out so you cant use the egg as storage  nor does the egg close securely  ours never stays closedso while an inexpensive item it does have a lot of pieces that can get lost and spoil the point and fun|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|when the sideshow darth maul figure came out a lot of people were saying that it was sideshows best while it certainly had a lot of accessories especially if you got the exclusive version i never felt that it matched the nearperfection that was their kit fisto figure and not just in sculpt either but in clothing too not to mention that there were some minor problems that hold the figure back but if you cant afford the x as expensive meidcom version which surpasses this figure in nearly every way the sideshow figures still a good catchmaul comes with a lot of stuff two extra hands one has the droid wrist controller on it ignited lightsaber unignited lightsaber another lightsaber with only one side ignited binoculars and if you got the exclusive version battle damaged unignited lightsaber and battle damaged ignited lightsaber thats a lotta sabers the lightsabers also make mauls box a bit taller than the other figures the weapons all look good but i still dont care for how they get smaller towards the tip mauls outfit looks like it should but ill get more into that in a minute also despite him being on the buck body hes able to get some really good poses because of how little there is to the head and the lack of restriction in the outfit of course you should still upgrade to a different body if you want to get some really dynamic poses out of him but for once i can say that the buck will do the head sculpt is also welldone and i like that they included the stud in his earso it sounds good so far right here come the little things that keep it from being  stars or anywhere near as good as the medicom one first the red paint on his head looks faded compare it to screen shots from the movie and youll notice a difference right away then theres the dull expression on his face i hate to keep comparing but medicom got things right with that scowl theirs has sideshows looks more disinterested than anything his outfit while it does look decent isnt very wellmade the material on his tunic pants and robe is very very thin and feels like something hasbro wouldve made the shoulders are a bit too poofy and the robe is just an eye sore if you leave it on his big leather belt is worse the little studs on the sides come off easily and i lost  of them right after taking maul out of the box if you look at pictures of other sideshow maul figures that people took theres a good chance youll see a stud missing from theirs too whether they know it or notat the price he goes for though maul is a good addition to your collection if you have the money and get both this and the medicom version you can have the ultimate darth maul figure if you give the medicom one the sideshow lightsabers and pad him up a bit otherwise sideshows isnt as good but is still a heck of a lot better than their asajj ventress and many others|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the biggs darklighter figure i got had a pretty poor paint job it looked almost like there was blue ink and fingerprints on the jacket i bought it new in the package but online so i couldnt inspect it first moreover the face paint job was ok but the eyes look lifeless if the paint job were a bit better this would be an awesome biggs too bad|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been of all the mcquarrie figures though this one is my least favorite primarily because it looks so much like the final version of vader we all know and love thats partly because mcquarrie tackled vader first and had the best idea of what hed look like early on the figure itself is highly posable and has great detail|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this vintagestyle lom is smaller but much better than the previous versions this one is jet black whereas the previous versions had orange outlines which i guess were supposed to indicate rust but were nowhere on the real character the previous version was also a bit too large for the character lom admittedly isnt the most exciting character  hes basically cpo with a different head  but its nice to finally have a definitive version of him this lom would go great with the other vintagestyle bounty hunters in a diorama|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a nice version of juno eclipse this version has a solid sculpt although her legs are a bit difficult to pose youll probably have to bend her knees a bit to pose her straight one thing i like is that the cap stays on really well i personally prefer the one with the open jacket from the  tru force unleashed figure set as its more visually interesting but if you can find this one its worth getting as well|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|this action figure has a nice finishing and is sculpted fine but the face is quite generic mostly because of the painting of the face  you know it is a  inch action figure  what can you expectthis action figure is quite posable but you cant sit it down so it will need to stand up  i tried to make it to pilot a speeder bike and it did not work  also i tried to put it into the cockpit of the atat by hasbro and the holes in the feet are too small and do not fit the pins of the vehicle floor easily it should be a nightmate for kids to try to do it  since foot are a bit mobile and the holes are not located in the heels fitting it inside an atat is quite a painthe character in the wii game is more like a pilot but given these features it seems she will have to remain as a bureaucrat while playing giving orders while remaining stand up  since her feet are small making her to stand up requires the usage of vehicle floor pinshowever if you are willing to accept these limitations it is a nice toy  i do not regret it  but they may prove to be a problem for kids if they try to fit them inside vehiclesface detail averageoverall body detail excellentfabric clothes noaccesories gunmovie accuracy noissues it cant sit down will not fit ina vehicle with seatsbenchmarking naposeabilityshoulder articulation ballelbow articulation ballhip articulation ball but limited by costumeknees articulation ballfeet articulation ballnotice i use this nomenclature for articulationsno it has no articulationstandard rotates around a single axis provides limited poseabilityball provides the best poseability|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|what can i say  this is another great cantina alien you probably wouldnt know it but this alien species the givens are math geniuses elis herlot has a good sculpt and paint job with a draping shawl to provide some character as with many of the other cantina figures he actually looks more interesting than what you see in the movie ie that stiff rubber mask also i love the cantina bar as an extra i wish more figures came with background set pieces rather than simply those cards or buildadroid gimmicks|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been however im not so crazy about boba  hes essentially a white boba fett which isnt as interesting as the final green armor he wears in the moviesthe figure itself is highly posable and has great detail|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i got this recently for my nephew i remember back in the old days the jawas were always pretty stiff with no joints and little detail this guy looks pretty cool his arms and elbows move and he can be posed in quite a few directions i love the bandolier  it gives him more character than most jawas also the droid he comes with is actually pretty big and looks nice assembled if you get any jawa figure make sure its this one|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i know darth malak isnt the coolest looking sith lord but this figure is still a pretty decent replica of him i particularly like the face i looks pained and injured you can take the mouthguard off and see his injuries hes missing half a jaw unfortunately the elbow joints  or lack thereof  take this figure down a notch for me malak has swivel elbow joints not the more advanced ball joints this limits how you can pose him and also is a bit more conspicuous on the figure itself not too bad but i just dont understand why hasbro took this approach for malak but notably gave revan fully articulated arms still a great figure for kotor fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its nice to see lando in a different outfit this isnt the best paint job and the swivel elbows limit articulation but given that lando only wore this outfit for a few seconds on film its a miracle theres even a figure off it my biggest complaint is the legs they seem a bit too close together and the knee joints extend past  degrees so he can bend his leg forward at unnatural angles despite that he looks really good in the bmf millennium falcon|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its always nice to get expanded universe characters in hasbros figure line its even better when those characters are memorable individuals who play an important part in the stories rather than the random assortment of goons who populated the comic packs sublime tycho celchu comes with two helmets which is a nice touch his hair is probably a bit too blond for the character most sources depict him as dark blondlight brown but his face definitely captures the youthful arrogance of a young rogue squadron pilot definitely nice to have in the collection|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|if this is supposed to be a wing pilot he does not have the helmet of a wing pilot  if you watch the movie b wing cockpit has his helmet but a white outfit  a wing pilot has his outfit but none of the accesories for the head is movie accurate  we are told that the guy with the red outfit and the american football ball shaped helmet is a b wing pilot but you do not see such a b wing pilot in the movie  so i plan to use this action figure as the b wing pilot as he has a b wing helmet and leave the original a wing pilot that came with my a wing in his ship  the a wing pilot that came with the fighter does not have a movie accurate helmet but it is somehow more movie accurate than this action figure in terms of helmetsthis is a great action figure but please do not try to cheat hardcore fans telling us that this is an a wing pilot while his helmet is not what we see in the movie rotj  dont you believe me  watch the movie and pause and you will see  i would have given this action figure  stars but i took one star for not being movie accurate and another one for not being an a wing pilot while they say it is an a wing pilot|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been i love the snowtrooper concept figure hes pretty similar to the final version but has more detail and writing on his helmet unfortunately this figure cant stand up that well however it is possible to pose him to stand  even in a cool running position this one is my second favorite of the mcquarrie figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|what could be better than boba fett a boba fett with a cool new color scheme this figure is a great figure in and of itself with many points of articulation a beautiful paint job and a jetpack that doesnt fall off however hasbro also really managed to capture the look and style of the animated boba fett without making it look too cartoonish recommended for fans of boba fett and older star wars fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|cantina alien figures are always a hit with collectors and this one is particularly cool i dont know much about miiyoom onith but he is odd looking i really like how he comes with a portion of the cantina bar its a nice touch for dioramas i wish more figures came with sets or useful additions rather than the buildadroid gimmicks|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|first of all this is incredible value for your money as a figure you get both a quality yoda figure and a cool looking beast the kybuck the kybuck is a pretty cool looking beast like a cross between a tauntaun and a reindeer its an evolutionarily impossible creature as the legs probably couldnt support such a forwardleaning body but it looks awesome hasbro did a pretty good job with the paint job and sculpted fur the head arms legs and tail all have swivel joints yes more articulation would have been awesome but this is often as much as most star wars creatures get my only tiny complaint is that hasbro could have done a better job painting wear on the kybucks hoovesthe yoda figure itself isnt bad its a realistic looking yoda but wearing clone wars style clothing there isnt any elbow or knee articulation but hes stuck in a dramatic pose that looks great in most instances i do wish hasbro had made a peg hole in his butt so you could seat yoda on the kybuck without fear of him falling over yoda looks great riding the kybuck standing but id have preferred both optionsgiven the price this is a nobrainer even if youre not a fan of the original clone wars cartoon this set of beast and rider belongs in every collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i always love the star wars figures that put real people into the saga this one is a figure of artist ralph mcquarrie who in fact did have a cameo in empire as a rebel general in terms of the quality of the figure its very good although the hair looks a bit too white for me remember its based on mcquarrie  years ago also he doesnt look as cool with the helmet on then again given that the face sculpt is so good there no reason to put it on id recommend getting this figure along with the excellent mcquarrie concept figures series|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these two guys are some of the best ewok figures ive seen yet im literately in awe of the accessories romba has a small knife that goes into his sheath graak has a very detailed bow that comes with three separate arrows that you can put in his pouch they both have neck wrist shoulder waist hip and ankle joints the detail is great i love their faces  much more realistic eyes than even the costumes in the movie this twopack is a bit expensive to find secondhand but definitely worth it if you need more ewoks|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i wasnt crazy about all of the original force unleashed figures but maris brood does alright the likeness is pretty good and her skin has a creepy withered skin tone to it unfortunately her hands are too big to hold the lightsabers by the side handle but she can hold them well enough like regular lightsabers otherwise a strong figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i thought the ig from the s was good but this one is spectacular the paint job is beautiful and eerily mechanic some of the wires on him really stick out and can be moved plus hes got a machete on his back which is a neat yet disturbing tough this version of ig is no walking tin man but a hunting machine|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|talk about an obscure character after jabba catches leia freeing han instar wars episode vi  return of the jedihermie odlebellows a deep laugh that encourages all of the other goons to laugh ive always thought he looked more like something out of jim hensonsthe dark crystal anyway this figure is great and in line with the quality of hasbros more recent figures the cloth feels very realistic and looks tattered you have to play with it to get it draped over him correctly but once you do it looks great the figure has several points of articulation including the jaw which opens and closes overall this guy is great if you just want somebody lurking in the depths of your jabbas palace diorama|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the most impressive thing about this figure is the paint job hasbro combined a metallic look for the droids body but threw a lot of dirt rust and ooze on him to make him look appropriately manhandled at jabbas palace generally the joints are even well covered in paint although there are a few areas where the joint looks clean thats a small complaint though for this otherwise beautiful figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|one thing i appreciated about the tartakovsky clone wars was its bold visual images one of the coolest images was that of the hammerhead jedi whod have thought wed ever see one of those i love the way he looks this guy is easily one of my favorite jedi figureshasbro made the character in realistic style so he looks fine next to the regular star wars figures and this isnt just a retool of momaw nadon either its an all new sculpt the figure comes loaded with articulation including ankle and knee joints my only small complaint is that he only has swivel elbows not ball jointoverall a nice tribute to tartakovskys series|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been this figure is kind of a concept version of leia but not really in some ways shes more like a han solo with a blaster and smugglers outfit the figure itself is highly posable and has great detail the mask does sometimes get in the way and a bit annoying otherwise a very cool figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|what can i say hasbro knew fans wanted a nice version of darth revan and they got it this is a beautiful figure the arms have all the points of articulation modern fans demand the cloak is plastic but is painted in dull colors so it almost looks like cloth its a neat effect you can also take the cloak off to reveal revans head which looks like its wrapped in bandages but not his facethe only thing lacking is articulation for the legs basically the legs have no articulation this works fine in most cases because revans legs are under his cloak but it would have been nice to have the option for additional poses also an additional lit blue lightsaber would have nice so we could switch i took one from a jedi knightbe warned though this figure is rare and expensive you might be able to find one cheaper on ebay but star wars fans love revan and hasbro unfortunately didnt produce enough of them as happens so often so be prepared to spend at least  times the normal price for a figure if you want to add revan to your collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|one thing i appreciated about the tartakovsky clone wars was its bold visual images one of the coolest images was that of the wolfman jedi whod have thought wed ever see one of those and whod have thought wed ever get an action figure of himhasbro made the character in realistic style so he looks fine next to the regular star wars figures he comes pretty loaded in the articulation department although he lacks knee joints then again given his doublejointed knees i guess that excusable the only thing that bothers me a bit is the face it looks a bit cartoonish it might be that the head is just a bit too big for the bodyoverall a nice tribute to tartakovskys series|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is an interesting figure its darth vader after his battle with starkiller its certainly a new way to look at darth vader hasbro did a good job recreating the battle damage vaders skin looks sickened while his cape is in tatters there are also small pieces of his armor you can reinsert to cover up some of the damage this effect works well but i think vader looks better completely off the helmet in particular doesnt always sit well overall this figure is great for a diorama with starkiller|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|quinlan vos has quite a following and this figure set is a great tribute the vilmarh grahrk figure is great the figure is posed in such a way as to suggest a confident swagger the quinlan figure could use some help  the face is painted rather than molded fortunately theres an easy fix just take the tvc quinlan head and put it on this ones neck you might want to fill the head hole with some putty to make it fit better id love to see hasbro revise this quinlan figure but its still my favorite version of him|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love heir to the empire and thought this would be the revised mara jade figure weve all been waiting for unfortunately its not while its not bad its not great the paint application on the face seems a bit off and mara looks like she has a receding hairline moreover the lightsaber seems to be a shaw of purple too light and the blade handle is very rubbery its certainly not a bad figure especially if its the only version of mara we get for another  years but given how prominent a character she is id hoped hasbro would have made her perfect|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|in an interview about the cantina scene mark hamil famously described kitik keedkak as a giant cricket unfortunately the tech crew never really got this alien down well enough for a closeup in the movie but you can see him in the background i was excited to finally see a figure of this guy to add to my cantina scene when kitik keedkak get his own figure you know that hasbro has made figures just about every other alien as such this guy is great for collectorsthe figure itself is somewhat stiff like the prop used in the movie she cant bend his arms much or turn her head also the stand says attack of the clones even though kitik keedkak only appears in a new hope however the detail and painting are great for collectors she stands well enough to ask wuher for a glass of cricket juice or whatever she drinksmy recommendation would be to buy the threeset with wuher dr evazen and kitik keedkak star wars original trilogy collection  mos eisley cantina w dr evazen wuher and kitik keedkak action figure multipack if you dont already have the other two figures if you do have them id recommend getting kitik keedkak to fill out the cantina|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|granted i didnt play many board games growing up in fact i can count them all on one hand but candy land was one of them and easily my favorite when i was younger my daughter got this version of candy land as a gift and we finally had a chance to play it the games still fun and im surprised at how much fun she was getting out of it we played  games over the course of an hourif youve never played candy land its very simple up to  players play on the board which is drawn out like a map for candy land your goal is to make it to the kings candy castle by drawing cards each card will have one color two colors or a character on it if you draw a color you move your character to the closest square of that same color if its a two color card you move two spaces if its a character you move forward or back to that location you can also lose a turn by landing on one of the few spaces made for that see very simplethe maps changed a bit from when i was younger and has different charactermonster designs on it but its still cute the player pieces are little gingerbread men in  colors red green blue and yellow and you get a good number of cards to play with we usually only went through about half of the cards when playing but you can always shuffle the used pile and start again if you run out the main feature of this edition here is that it comes in a book the map gingerbread pieces and cards are stored in a plastic tray within the book which is a hard plastic case the image on the front slides off revealing the game and you unfold the map its a really cool way to store the game and more practical than the huge boxes a lot of board games come in my only minor complaint is that the map needs to be on a flat surface since its folded into  sections but not entirely connected if you lay it on a bed or couch the board will probably be lopsided on one of the folds but hey the instructions do say to lay it on a flat surface but sometimes you have to improviseall in all candy land should be fun for younger kids and is something good for parents to play with them you can always change things up a bit and use your favorite smaller toys as game pieces if your kids ever get sick of the gingerbread men pokemon and ghostbusters in candy land makes for some zany fun|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i use this toy for color matching  the pieces are very flexible hold up well to play and are not too hard to connect  the only thing that would add to the fun would be if you could put different heads and bodies together to create your own animal combinations  this doesnt work because the animals are not all facing the same way so the heads are backward if you put them on the wrong body  it is still a great toy|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is cute and unique and i love how open ended it is  you can use it for pretending shape sorting color matching or even playing a sort of memory game  i found that the lid stays on ours pretty well so maybe the company worked on this problem  the only reason i took off a star is that some of the chocolates have plastic bubbling where the  halves meet so they dont fit together as snugly as they should  this bugs me but my kids dont care at all and still love this toy|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|ive always been a big fan of science fiction so i jumped at the opportunity to get my twoandahalfyearold his very own rocket ship for christmas  finally a scifi toy made for children his age right i mean the product details read  our recommended age  months   years and manufacturer recommended age  months and up  and yet theres a big warning in the center of the page choking hazard  small parts not for children under  yrs  amazon cant seem to make up its mind there are no small parts that i can see would be a choking hazardthe rocket is big  my boy is not a big kid so its a bit difficult for him to lug the  pounds of rocket ship around  the big handle on the side which has a red button you can see it in the picture looks like the rocket is meant to be lifted and carried through the air but thats only feasible with bigger kids who have the wrist strengththe ship itself had three rockets connected to it  the bottom part of each rocket glows when it takes off more about that later and provides a very stable base when placed on a flat surface  it wont fall over easilythe bottom part of the rocket includes a storage compartment  the storage compartment includes a minibuggy which fits one astronaut  the buggys wheels and all of the international playthings space toys are made of solid rubber which makes them very durable and less prone to curving when rolledthe middle part of the rocket includes a foldout murphy bed what you dont see in the picture is that the bed covers a toilet  this has to be the first toy with a space toilet ive ever seen the kitchen includes an attached microwave but you wont be able to close the living quarters with the bed down  the bed is actually made to cradle one of the astronauts heads with a slight concave depression  these little details really show the amount of thought put into this toythe pilot compartment is straightforward  it flips up and two astronauts lay in it  whats interesting is that they sit in it the same way astronauts in real rockets do  their backs to the ground facing towards the sky  my son has a little difficulty comprehending this point he thinks theyre sleeping but its definitely an educational plusthere are two astronauts one orange one blue and a space dog  the space dog cracks me up but he seems to be an afterthought he doesnt fit anywhere  not in the buggy not in the little moon crater and not really anywhere in the rocket  he can sit on the bed bad dog if you want to store hima bright green alien looks friendly enough with three eyes and a pair of suctioncupped hands folded in front of his tummy  hes not quite the same size as the aliens so he cant fit anything made for astronauts therell be no aliens stealing our ships no siroverall the rocket is fairly durable  the doors to the storage and living compartments open easily enough  the pilots compartment is flimsy however and i managed to yank the door right off trying to get it to open  fortunately it clicks right back inthe rocket has two sounds depending on whether its in space or landed on the ground  if its in space it makes what can only be described as space sounds  beeps and blips  holding down the button creates a continuous stream of these space sounds but again this requires considerably wrist strength to keep the rocket aloft while pushing the buttoni wasnt all that impressed with the rocket sounds until i pressed the button one day while it was sitting on a flat surface  and then hoo boy you get a full countdown complete with echoing fivefivefive fourfourfour from mission base to rocket one  the rocket then makes a blast off sound and the base of the rocket lights up  awesomeuntil you try to land it of course  the rocket has no landing sequence for some reason electronic toys these days can encompass entire cds full of music so why this rocket is always blasting off and never landing is a mysterymy son mostly uses the astronauts in other play sets theyre victims for a lot of traps in his dragon castle  im confident hell play with the rocket more as he gets older i know i sure will it definitely made an impression on him though as evidenced by the time he put a transparent drum over his head and shouted im an astronaut|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters loved games since she was  starting with the nintendo ds shell be  in less than  months and shes enjoying a lot of platform games like littlebigplanet donkey kong country and the first couple super mario bros games she got the vsmile system for her birthday earlier this year but hasnt used it a whole lot some of the reasons being that like other customers have pointed out the system is selective on working but also because the games can get a bit boring at times usually i dont just list out pros and cons but thats probably the best way to go about the vsmile and i dont want to be onesided on the product when it does have some positive things about itprosyou can switch the joystick around so it can be for left or right handed kids this is very cool of them to do and something they didnt have to includebig bright buttons that are easy to remember the locations ofit uses game cartridges instead of discs so you dont have to worry about games being too scratched to playthe games weve bought so far are more of the standard platform game while being educational rather than being a learning tool first and a fun game secondsome games have a  player optionsurprisingly good audio for a cartridgebased systemconsthe carts sometimes cant be read and you have to blow into the bottom of them like the nes daysthe joystick isnt very stable and can spin around when you move it making controlling your character hard at timesthe controller and system both feel flimsy and if they drop on any hard surface theyre pretty much toastsometimes the system doesnt start up even when the cords are plugged in properly and the cart is pushed in all the way youll get a constant loop of the vsmile start up screen until you turn it off then try againa lot of the games are overpriced for the content they provide and youre better off getting them usedthere might be more pros in my view but the cons are pretty big ones regarding the games being fun or sometimes repetitive it depends on what you get some of the more fun ones that ive seen are the wow wow wubbzy go diego go and backyardigans one those are great for kids  there are games that lean more toward the educational side spongebob comes to mind here rather than being regular games but kids have to be more familiar with numbers and things like greater thanless than in terms of weight the vsmile can be a good purchase and the price isnt too bad but some games cost nearly as much as the system and when it wont work at times then its hard to say much in the systems favor if you have friends or relatives who have one of these give it a test before deciding on buying one for your kids|ham

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this is a great toy because it is a very interesting stacker compared to the usual rings and pole most babies have  it offers different combinations so that babies can be more creative  there isnt just one right way to stack them up  i also like the other features like wheels and a light on one piece a mirror on another and different bbells and rattles on others  my daughter has a lot of fun with these and they also help her with her problem solving because she has to figure out what order they should go in|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is very cute and educational  it doesnt look like it does that much but there is a lot that babies and young toddlers seem to love  my daughters favorite thing is to pull on the ring that makes the rainbow spinner go and to drop balls in the tube  she and i both like how everything you do activates a song sound or some kind of learning like abcs or counting  it is a great way to reward her and keep her coming back for more  all in all it is fun|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|some of these locks are enough of a challenge but others just fall open almost without any help at all  the chain one and the hook and loop one never stay locked for a child to unlock them  this is too easy for any children to do more than a few times|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this is the cutest shape sorter i have seen so far but still didnt impress me  the shapes are hard to get in the holes unless it is exactly a certain way  i also like sorters with more than  shapes  i was able to find a plan toys one with |ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is great and very fun for my kids  the only problem i have is with the elevator which is sort of stiff and harder to move up and down than i would like  you just slide it up and down and i think a crank would make it easier  the spiral ramp is the best feature  my kids love zooming cars down over and over|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is great because it teaches cause and effect  push the button and get rewarded with the music and lights and the movement of the ball  my daughter likes it a lot  she likes to see if she can get all  bugs to pop up|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a really neat concept  that the corners unzip and the box flattens into a play mat  the lid is also terrained and adds extra interest  its made of durable vinyl plastic that looks like it will last a long time  my daughter greatly enjoys playing with it and i like that it zips up  the dinosaurs are tiny but it is easy to go to the dollar store and find more in that size for more play valuethe reason i rate this  star instead of  is that it doesnt have a closer so the lid just fits on loosely  it would have been better to have velcro or some kind of snap to keep the lid on since it falls off quite easly  and the dinosaurs are tiny and very cheap  look like the cheapos you get from china with bad molding and poor painting|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|my daughter wanted to play with the balls more than the actual helicopter  there are better toys out there in my opinion that hold a childs attention better  i also found this one to be annoying because you cant shut it off manually  its one of those that shuts off when you arent playing with it but it was always randomly going off at night and scaring my kids|ham

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|my yearold has trouble lacing these  it is hard because the holes are not always in a straight line so the shape of the animals will look right  she misses holes all the time and cant figure out which hole comes next  these are very wellmade toys and a good educational tool but i recommend the lacing shapes instead for younger kids|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|these are great because the shapes are not too complicated but are still enough of a challenge to make them worth buying  they are sturdy as well  these help to teach handeye coordination and i would recommend them|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|you can use this to teach matching colors or shapes  it is also a great cause and effect toy since you get a bell light or spinning action when you put the two halves together  my daughter is fascinated by these|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is our third mega rig  we also have the pirate ship and the train from toy story the train has seen steady use for  months now  crazy good value for my hard earned dollars when i showed the picture of this to my  year old he went crazy and then he was ecstatic when we opened it he immediately started assembling it himself and when i took it over to put together the claw he already had one of the little men inside the sharks tummy  he loves it as one giant ship and he also loves using pices of it  his favorite is the two little four wheeled vehicles he puts the pin and hole coupling together and runs it around the room making vroooooom sounds then hell snap the little kayaks on top of each and runs those around they also couple at each end of the kayakslove so many options so much return on your investment he doesnt get bored because there is always something different to make these mega rigs are entertainment for months the shark is awesome i love it that you can move the fin and make his mouth open and close and that you can put a person in his tummy hes had a thing for claws ever since toy story  so he loves the claw on this it actually does pick things up and you can catch the shark with it just above his tail he loves the shark cage he puts a diver in it then has the shark hunt the diver in his bathtub goes from bathtub to sandbox just finenotes like the pirate ship doesnt float  stay upright in waterbut you can attach the kayak things to the side for balance the attachment pegs dont form a really strong bond this is good because my  year old can take them apart and put them together no problem its a nuisances at other times though  every time i pick it up i have to be careful to put my hands at the bottom and pick up carefully or pieces fall offin the video my son put his blankets down on his roller coaster to simulate water  my son has asked for a bath every single night since we got this  hes very clean|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|wherena  newtons apples  words once uttered by richard pryorbriarpatch is known for educational simple games with clear directions right so what the heck happened here set up is easy pieces are sturdy but the directions were so confusing that i am glad that i only paid two bucks for this at the goodwill as it is just acting as a side table to a low chair in my daughters room i am not psyched at all to find out what this game is all about my advice just buy some real apples and find a hill and do not purchase this game|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i just thought these were flimsy but i guess thats what you get from foam  i also didnt like that the wires would poke out of the tube shapes after a while|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i like this toy because of all the settings it has  the train is great because it doesnt move too fast or slow  it goes at the perfect speed to promote crawling but it is great when left stationary for younger babies  i also really like the put and take action it promotes|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i swear all the cool stuff comes out after i grow upmy daughters really into the monsters from godzilla right now and her favorite is king ghidorah there isnt exactly a lot of merchandise of the guy right nowat least not in a very affordable price range there are plenty of vinyl figures and model kits most of which are longsold out fortunately this little guy here is still around not only is it a cute take on the three headed king but its definitely something unique in the world of godzilla collectibles he just arrived in the mail this week and my daughters face lit up when she saw him i gotta admit i couldnt help but smile too who wouldve guessed that the same people who brought us beanie babies would go and make little plush godzilla characters tooghidorah stands at about  inches tall from foot to the tip of his wing hes stuffed like your typical stuffed animal and doesnt have any little pellets like beanie babies do i was very surprised by the work that went into it like how they gave his body a pattern to make it look like there are scales along with some fur on the tips of both tails and the spikes down the back of the middle neck both the wings and his claws have a cool texture to them adding a little bit more to the toys design instead of leaving them one plain color all three heads look great too and from the right angle even look like goats their horns can be shaped a little bit too since theyre not stuffed and just the fabric on its own the eyes are plastic and probably the only thing that could be a hazard to young kidsat this price theres nothing bad to say youre getting a fairly large stuffed ghidorah my daughter has already taken hers on trips and hes a regular snuggle buddy for bed time now if only theyd make a gamera|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to love about this figure its so unique in the star wars universe in fact it looks like something out of a s scifi flick the blade on top actually rotates like a helicopters the wires are very well done giving this figure a used droid look my only complaint is that because the legs are so thin the figure doesnt really stand well and might stoop one way to address this problem is to open its mouth wide enough so it acts as a third leg however i wish hasbro had used a harder plastic for those legs overall this is still an awesome piece for any star wars figure collection|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|as with other non mattel disney toys this looks better in pictures than actually playing with it  im not sure what happened with disney quality but nearly every disney item we own breaks easily and is of poor qualitylike other reviewers we had the same issues with the clip that holds it together just falling off  there are a lot of little pices great for choking on stepping on or simply losing  the swing breaks easily and is a real pain to get back together  the princes cloak never stays on the pillar doesnt stay up and the pieces dont fold correctlyi could go on|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the minute i started taking this out of the box pieces started falling off  they were clear plastic tags that hang on the carousel and were impossible to find in a carpet once they dropped  the thing looks assembled but is actually in quite a few pieces and needs to be assembled  i tried and tried but could not get this to work  all those loose pieces made it rickety and unstable  this ended up being a pointless effort in frustration and to add insult to injury id find those little plastic pieces days later by stepping on them painfullythis was never used once  i didnt even like the outfits it came with  certainly not for a child under the age of  since it is so rickety|ham
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|elves have always been dualclass types both fighters and spellcasters  its a challenge to portray this dualclassing in a sculpt but werner klocke has the solution a sword in one hand and a staff in the other  never mind that gandalf did it first or that theres not particularly memorable elves wielding the symbols of fighter and wizard together  lysettes doing it because it looks coolheres what reaper has to say about lysetteit is said that all elves are ineffably touched by magic few however develop the mental fortitude to bend and shape the fleeting capricious energies of this plane to their will even at a young age it was readily apparent that lysette had an exceptional talent and an unquenchable thirst for all things arcane welltraveled and trained in the halls of venerated magi both elven and human she answered almirithils call to arms unhesitatingly quite possibly lysette is spurred by rumors of longforgotten libraries and sanctums buried in the elven ruins of craclaw and denelspireor to put it another way lysettes your bogstandard swordstaff wielding elflysette has a long runeengraved sword in one hand a crystaltipped staff in the other  her long flowing hair is impractical for combat so we can assume that the sword is more of a casting tool than a weapon  herr klocke manages to make lysette look elvish too  in the runes on her sword and scabbard her pointed ears and her fantastic fashion sense a suitable eldritch knight if you happen to be playing a female elf|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|you might have heard a debate that raged a long time ago as to whether or not dwarf women had beards  you can blame this on jrr tolkien who in appendix a of the lord of the rings statedthey are in voice and appearance and in garb if they must go on a journey so like to the dwarfmen that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apartthis leads one to understandably believe that dwarf women have beards because otherwise itd be pretty easy to tell them apart  in the war of the jewels tolkien explicitly statedno man nor elf has ever seen a beardless dwarf  unless he were shaven in mockery and would then be more like to die of shame for the naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives male and female alikeor to put it another way yep dwarven women have beards  this debate raged in dragon magazine at length but it comes down to this  not all players find playing a bearded lady appealing  sculptor werner klocke feels the same way  this isnt a surprise as herr klocke has a  how shall we say fondness for the feminine formonce you get past the beard issue the question remains as to how to make a female dwarf feel both feminine and dwarvish freja manages to be just thatms fangbreaker is just straight up dwarvishly awesome she has a symbol of law an arrow or the futhark rune for the letter t on her axe and holds a wooden shield with the same t symbol she has a cool helmetstyle belt buckle and her hair is in braids  she looks regal and ferocious  and because this is a sculpt by klocke she has an ample exposed busomshe earns my vote for nonbearded dwarven women|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|its hard to blame sculptors like werner klocke for making so many twoweapon fighters  after all it makes the character that much interesting when the figure has another weapon in its hand  dualwielding rangers are particularly suitable and elladan is no exception with his sword and daggerhe has a cloak of course and herr klocke added his usual flourishes in this case a leaf theme that clearly designates elladan as a ranger not a rogue who happens to like pointy things  unlike some of the other dualwielders elladan looks like a ranger at first glance which is how it should be|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|whether you liked mirrormask or not you cant deny that the sphinx cats in that movie were messed up i loved them as soon as they appeared i knew i had to have something of them be it a poster or cardboard cutout luckily i found this bad boy and ordered him immediately heck i ordered a second one just so i could have both faces displayed im still confused as to who actually made this statue gentle giant or diamond select the box has gentle giants logo on it and yet when i contacted their customer service about getting a replacement they said that this statue wasnt made by them how bout that youd think theyd want to say that they made it considering that if it is its one of the products by them thats actually worth buyingthe sphinx is superbly sculpted and its body is as sleek as the standard apple product its shiny and features a combination of purple silver and grey colors you place him on the base via pegs in the feet and he stands up perfectly with no risk of falling over on his own the face plates were a great feature and you get one with a neutral expression and the other has more of a smilinghungry look both of these have pegs that easily go into little holes on the shinxs head though they are at risk of falling off because of how small the pegs are be careful that nothing bumps into it because the face plates are pretty thin and while mine never broke no matter how high they fell i could see it happening at some point the wings are gorgeous and as you see in the picture have tons of colors i can proudly say that what you see in the picture is most likely what youll get with the actual statue something thats rarely said with gentle giant products hey maybe it really isnt made by them then the bottom of the base has your standard x out of x made info and all thatsadly its the wings that also have the biggest problem over the course of a few months my first sphinxs wings began to droop theyre actually quite bendy unlike the rest of the statue so be careful with these too but mine didnt stop at the drooping the paint started to chip away too until the wings just plain snapped off i was heartbroken i dont know if it had to do with temperature or what but it still happened and you should consider it before buying as well something else is quality control with the paint on my first sphinx the paint on him was flawless and the face plates had a lot of different tones on the second sphinx his face was almost entirely grey with no shading like what you see in the picture its not a big deal but im picky when it comes to things like that and when youre paying for a high end collectible you expect things to be done righteven with that major problem i still think about buying another one of these because of how great it was whenever id look at the sphinx id smile right back at it the fact that this even got made is incredible since the movie pretty much bombed if only they wouldve made others for this line aside from just the dark queen so much potential but im still happy with what we got if you liked the sphinx at all and can get one of these for a good price go for it|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we really wanted to love this  my daughter couldnt wait to get it  but right out of the box the tree did not go into the stand well barely at all since it doesnt fit in well it doesnt push down in order to turn on  so we dont get to use this with the sounds and timed tree flip  that takes a lot away from the gamethe stands are cheap and honestly difficult to use  out of   year olds at a birthday party only one was able to get a frog on a tree  the rest gave up annoyed and frustrated and just started to throw the frogs at each other  the stands are cheap and not well designed enough so that a child can hold the stand while flipping the frog  often fingers or hands just get in the way and the frog drops onto the flooralso frustrating is that the tree doesnt disassemble again afterwards so it no longer fits in the box  seriously  who wants a toy that doesnt store neatly in the boxin all id wait to buy this until version a redesign pops up|ham

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|at the age of eleven my mother was on parole for the weekend and took me to seaworld to see the dolphins sharks and aquatic petting zoo having spent a wonderful day together we planned to make one last stop at the penguin encounter get my face painted like a marine animal and then go see one of her friends to get her a new tattooupon entering the exhibit we wandered apart looking at the various sights when i realized that she was nowhere to be found i started to worry where she might be further compounding the situation i needed to go to the bathroom with no bathroom in sight and the growing sense of urgency to pee further decreased my rational thoughtbeing in a darkened exhibit area i saw a door light up the immediate surrounding area as it opened and closed quickly from one of the seaworld employees exiting without delay i went towards the door opened it and entered the long corridor hustling down the path looking to and fro frantically searching for a restroom or at least an employee who could direct me to oneas my pace increased in the welllit steryl hallway i found a door partially open with apparent plumbing pipes visible thinking it would to lead to a bathroom i hurried through it and down that cool wet hallway to another door that was opened upon entering it i immediately felt a dramatic drop in the tempreture and realized i had actually entered the area the penguins lived inthe door behind me shut as i turned around to leave trying to open the locked door was a futile efforthearing a series of slow moving crunch noises i slowly turned around and saw something more disturbing than a sequel to happy feet was a a group of penguins standing upright in the snow towards methe crunching sound increased as they walked towards me it was at that point i lost control of my bladderto this day im not sure exactly what happened after that it seems like a blur having only bits here and there with a frenzy of penguins above me as i rolled about on the snow covered ground and frozen cement floori do recall coming slowly back to consciousness while being dragged out naked by a couple of guys in arctic gear and then pending a few hours in a medical facility at seaworldthe car ride from the park with my mom was a silent one neither of of said a word i remained in the car that evening while she was getting her tattooi felt confused angry and somewhat thrilled by what happened how was i to ever sort out what had happenedits been years since that took place ive had some therapy my mother went back to prison however i have found peace from that lifechanging event through my volunteer work at a local aviary cleaning bird cages it has given me time to reflect and sort out my feelings as a result the realization of my strong connection some say unhealthy attraction to birdsi picked up this tube of penguins to remind me that life changing moment|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive had a lot of fun collecting some of necas head knockers over the last couple of months and enjoy finding some surprisingly cool ones that were released a few years ago that arent in stores any more one of those that perked my interest immediately was jeannie here i love older tv shows like i love lucy the munsters i dream of jeannie that girl and more and in finding a bobblehead of one of tvs hottest ladies i had to get it while i didnt have the same great luck i did with stripe from gremlins and slimer from ghostbusters as far as the paint goes this is still a very cool head knocker that you should get immediately while theyre still available this one is listed as retired on necas sitejeannie comes in a great pink box with drawings of her as she appears in the animated opening sequence the head knocker looks exactly as it does in the stock picture with no changes made to the design theres not a whole lot of detail because this is a simple sculpt but it works and looks fantastic in bobbleheadform shes doing her classic wishgranting pose with her arms crossed her lamp is on the base with what looks like sand around her feet the lamp looks just like it should and probably has the most detail of anything here jeannies head bobbles when you move it making this a real head knocker unlike some of the others in the line which wobble at the waist or somewhere elsesadly mine came with below average paint and this is to be expected from neca whoever painted this never learned the stay within the lines thing and mine has some messy eyes lips and theres even an unpainted spot on the teeth i can take care of that myself but neca definitely needs to step up on quality control the sand lamp and her name on the base all look good so why get lazy on the most important part the face in the chance that you find a few of these at a store you might want to inspect them before buying in case you want a good onestill this is a great bobblehead and the colors make her stand out from all my others when i walk by my shelf and see her i cant help but hum the theme in my head|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|first of all dont be confused by amazons listing this isnt a toy its a work of art neca has really outdone itself this time with this gollum figure this figure is perhaps a perfect blend of articulation and aesthetics you can pose him in almost any way you want and he looks amazing in those poses neca spared no expense with the paint applications gollum looks incredibly realistic you can even see the faint blue veins running along his foreheadone thing thats worth mentioning is that in hand gollum actually looks better than the prototype photos amazon has posted here in those pictures it looks like the joints really stick out almost like an old wooden puppet im glad to say that in hand the joints blend much better into the rest of the figure so dont be put off by the photos herethe only problem with this figure is that gollum doesnt include the ring it would have been nice for neca to have at least given us a small ring to go with him fortunately it turns out that the lego gold ring from the lego hobbit playsets fits the  scale gollum perfectly and you can buy them on ebay for about a dollar so id definitely recommend getting one to make gollum completein short this would have been my favorite adultcollector toy from  but its such fine craftsmanship that calling it a toy seems like a disservice if youre a fan of peter jacksons take on gollum just get this|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|when it comes to  scale figures sideshow is far from the best they constantly put out figures with either heads too big arms too long silly looking face sculpts poor paint applications or not enough accessoriesand yet their prices continue to rise but just a few years ago old ben kenobi was released and he was so good that it almost made me give them a second chance obiwans head sculpt is on par with anything by hot toys and thats saying a lot the first time i saw this figure in person i was stunned it looks like sideshow somehow shrank down alec its that good why they cant put this much effort into their other figures i dont know but if youre a fan of obiwan and only want one  scale figure of him this is the one to get and get this the face looks even better than sideshows own and much more expensive premium format figureobiwan is almost  perfect in every category ive already raved about the head sculpt and the hands are just as good you get two closed one for a force gesture and another for a blaster or to use as if hes adjusting his beard he also comes with an ignited lightsaber and just the hilt the typical training droid he had luke use on the falcon and the standard sideshow stand his outfit is excellent especially the boots while it might seem weird to bring them up since theyre usually going to be covered by the robe sideshow made them stand out on their own as they do with most of the other jedi boots he also has quite a few layers of clothes what you see is not all of what you get theres more he has a nice turtle neck sweater under the tunic and robe and the pants as well his jedi robe is a bit of a mixed bag it looks good but because they went with the frayed look its one piece of cloth with no sewing on the edges so if you pull a string the whole thing could be a goner in no time so watch it with thathonestly the only other bad thing is that obiwan uses the old buck body luckily you can get a hot toys true type body put obiwans head hands and outfit on it and have a much better figure and hey itll still cost less than what most hot toys figures go for these days if you keep everything on the buck body though youll have limited articulation and wont be able to get a lot of dynamic poses though i guess ol bens not really suited for that any more at this point huh thats just my preference though and it may be different from yoursill also mention that youll want to be careful when switching hands the holes in the wrists of the hands are so small that i thought i was going to break the pegs on the arms whenever i switched them all the more reason to get a different bodyif you ever wanted an example of what a great  scale figure should look like obiwan here would be hard to beat he may be lacking in the accessories a bit and they couldve done his robe better but when looking at him on a shelf i have no complaints kinda regret selling mine now|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the g droids have always been among my favorites in the star tours preride room i recently went on the star tours  ride and was happy to see that there are still two g droids there this figure is a great commemoration of the g droids from the original ride its got a fair amount of articulation for such a small and thin figure with shoulder hip and neck joints the paint and sculpt are both pretty good best of all you can find these for a reasonable price my only complaint is that the legs are quite even meaning the figure actually stands on a leg and kicks its left leg forward still it actually makes for a cool pose make sure to get one because theyll go with either the original star tours or new star tours  figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been the differences between the concepts and the finals are mindblowing leia was more like han solo with a smugglers outfit and blaster ben kenobi looked more like a traditional samurai boba fett was pure white han solo had a lightsaber the stormtroopers had lightsabers as figures theyre also fun they all have incredible detail i particularly like the snowtroopers dirty look definitely some of the most unique star wars figures around|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|unfortunately the dooku figure included with this speeder bike is pretty dated i had hoped i could use it with the more recent superarticulated dooku figures but alas they dont fitthe speeder bike itself is ok but suffers from the gimmicky action features there is a large button on the back that pushes a part of the seat forward to trigger dookus action feature it sticks out quite a bit the paint job is fine but lacks any weathering or detailultimately i doubt well get an updated version of this anytime soon so if youre dying to have dookus speeder you cant beat the price but just be aware it wont fit modern figures and probably wont meet the standards of modern collectors|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the long and short of it is that the version of anakin skywalker included in this set is horrible but the swoop bike is pretty cool the bike is a lot better than the shadows of the empire version produced during the s its much more detailed has weathering and has a more realistic seating arrangement id still like hasbro to make an even better swoop bike but for now this set is worth getting just for the bike especially at the current prices on amazon i resold the anakin figure and put dengar in the seat of the swoop bike and it looks great|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|i bought this ship and also i bought dash rendar as i enjoyed shadows of the empirei realized that this ship was poorly designedeven if the outline from top matches there is a big hole between the central turret and the cockpit that is not in this toy i can forgive that inaccuracyin the opposite side of the cockpit it has a huge gun that is not present in the outrider design  where did it come from i do not know i can forgive that inaccuracycockpit seems to be designed without taking proper care of making dash rendar action figure to fit  there is a left panel that keeps action figure leg in place but it would be useful if rendars legs were straight but thats not the case  so trying to fit rendar inside the cockpit is just like trying to fit a square inside a circle  in the end you end up having him inside after applying some brute force but he looks inclined in the chair i cannot forgive thatif you look at the real outrider from the front you may notice it has a prominence where the turrets are  this toy does not have that  this toy seems made for kids in which case  is about triple of the top acceptable pricethe real outrider was like a small millenium falcon  but instead of making it in a way you could open it and instead of making it to have  seats they decided to make a senseless design with a cockpit that has an arm with rotation  weird pretty weird  in the end this toy seems more a single seat fighter for kids but kids or even adults may have huge problems fitting dash action figuredid someone like this toy   stars no i wont give such a rating here it does not get one star but two just because i loved the story and ths is closest we can get today to the real outrider but it does not hide the fact that the design is pretty dumbbut if you are a picky collector you may be disappointed with the overall design not only because it is not movie accurate if you compare it to the videogame  it is evident for me that this outrider was  not designed by star wars fans  if you are a parent who is looking for some non mainstream toy for your kid beware of the action figure fitting issue and the greedy price the seller is asking for it|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|this is one of those toys that i wish id picked up when i saw it in stores not too long ago both because i couldve gotten it for the original price and because i really did want it now that my daughters really into super heroes partially thanks to the marvel vs capcom games sentinels one of her favorite characters and she couldnt wait to have her own baby sentinel now that we have him the figure looks great but theres one huge problem and one little problem thats really unfortunate too considering how highly sought after this guy is now and many people probably dont know the issuesentinel is the main selling point of this pack and comes bundled with a unique maskless wolverine wolverine looks pretty good though his face is on the chubby side his head and arms are articulated just like all the other super hero squad figures the claws arent too pointy so theres no worry about your kids getting hurt when playing with him unless they jab the claws into their eyes for some reason as for sentinelhe looks awesome in super hero squad form and i love that they even made him smile he looks like hes about to give you a big ol robot hug the paint looks good too and i prefer this version over the variant that comes with cyclopshowever the bolted one has a glaring problem that im going to email hasbro about the big guy cant stand up his left foot has the heel slightly raised so that theres no way he can stand up on his own as hell always fall forward and guess what the only thing articulated on sentinel is the arms no leg articulation whatsoever the head and waist not being articulated the little problem i mentioned above i can live with and my daughter doesnt care about that either but not being able to stand up come on i checked a few sites and many people are reporting the same problems about uneven feet some of them luck out but im not finding many pictures of sentinel stand up on his own anywhere you might want to get these figures openedused to see if theyre defective or notbut as it is these toys are meant to be played with and my daughter has play fights with them all the time it irritates her that sentinel wont be standing on the edge of the bathtub with her other toys or on the coffee table when she has the other heroes standing there great looking figure but dont spend more than double the original price on this if its new in the box since you could end up with a postpatch mvc sentinel|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i do get the concept of the doll  that it gives girls a chance to sing to the music or allow the doll to sing if they want to hear the lyrics  but anytime you have two pieces one is going to end up getting lost  the microphone never seems to end up in the same place as the doll so the doll doesnt see as much use as the dolls that sing without needing an accessorymy  year old has this and the other singing microphone dolls  the microphones are interchangeable and you dont have to match them up  i wish more of the song was sung and that the dolls were more interesting looking|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these are both good figures the sculpts are detailed and include lots of wires to give them a realistic borg effect one note though this is the tng borg not the more creepy first contact ones|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|this is my second attempt to warn parents everywhere to not purchase this gal dont let her big browns fool ya she will release her wings within ten minutes of withdrawing from her cocoonbox she is the titanic of the doll world upbeat side note i purchased this doll at walmart in october  and it was then given to my kid at xmas time we then returned this doll at least  weeks after the new year january  i am a target chick at heart but walmart has great return policies they gave us our money back even after all that time had passed and yes you can return toys that are just plain suckyi used to think that you were not allowed to do that but the ordeal with this doll has proven that maxim wrong|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this has a lot of fun accessories  but clearly it is the two dolphins that my daughter likes to use the most with the doll  the color change on this is quite dramatic  she goes from a one piece purple bathingsuit to a  piece bikini  the dolphins themselves also change color once they are in waterto color change them shell be in hot bathwater and then just run some cold water from the faucet  they color change quite easily and dramaticallyin all we really like this set  it makes bath time a bit more fun when barbie has some friends to swim with in the bathtub  best of all  no clothes to lose|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we endure  months of winter and try to keep the heating bills down by setting our thermostat pretty low overnight  degrees  it gets pretty cold especially when you have to get up because one of the kids has woken up  i was going to bed with two layers of clothing the top being sweats and fuzzy socks every night and keeping flannel sheets on the beds and i was just not warm enough  therefore it didnt surprise me when my son complained about it being cold and he was taking longer to go to sleep at nighta friend showed me the aromatherapy warming seal that she had but i didnt like it because it was so hard it also had a smell that wasnt lavender any more and wasnt pleasant  i thought it would keep my son up at night so after looking at all the options on amazon we got wooly the sheep  we were so happy when he arrived  he is so soft he surprised us by being so hefty  he has a bean bag body and it is the filler that retains the heat when you put him in the microwave his head legs and arms are all normal soft plush without the filler  hes soft and pliablewe put him in for about  seconds and my son wraps him in his arms and falls asleep happily  after seeing this i had to get one  im so glad i did because this sheep suffuses me with warmth yet i find it cools down in the middle of the night and prevents me from waking up with a toohot feeling that i sometimes get if i go to sleep with all my layers onthis has been wonderful for my son and for me making our  months of cold a little easier to bear|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a great toy for kids and adults  the creators took all the fun aspects of the harley quinn character and loaded it into these vehicles it has a license plate that says love joker and all kinds of silly graphics to put on the truck that is very harley  both vehicles move easily on big rubber wheels and dont fall apart easily  easily this is one of the more playable of the lego sets  and fun too|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|as we build my  year olds thomas set we look for interactive elements  hes had the roundhouse for about two weeks and he absolutely loves it parking his wooden engines there to sleep  we saw this deluxe water tower and thought it might be another nice addition more fun than the regular water tower due to the lights sounds and actionthe water tower is a combination of wood and plastic and the spigot is plastic  the water is a plastic lit plastic interior piece that goes up and down as you move the spigot around  at the same time it makes water and train sounds and lights up when the tower is full  its cutemy son now stops the engines to fill up with water and turns the spigot around  one thing i like that is different from other water towers is that the spigot doesnt lower and raise it swivels  ive seen these other water towers have problems with the water spigot arm falling and getting in the way of the trains coming through  with this one if the spigot is turned over the track my son can still just whoosh the engine through pushing it aside as he goes  and he tends to do a lot of whooshing|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i honestly cant even remember seeing this droid on the original star tours ride however as a figure its great its got a unique look with a very different head from r it has translucent plastic on top and for the eye meaning that the eye looks like its glowing when the figure is under a light source its a nice effect one that i wish the newer figures still used overall a nice tribute to the original star tours ride|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|along with the tie defender and ewing jabbas sail barge was one of the rarest and most sought after action fleet items in the late s while the sail barge might not seem like the makings of a great action fleet ship this one is pretty good on its own its pretty realistic looking and probably still one of the best toys of the sail barge weve yet seen the hidden compartment with jabba doesnt do much for me but its not bad to have and is pretty inconspicuous also the figures are way too large for the ship but again under the sails are pretty inconspicuous the sails do twist and can come off a nice feature if you want to add more figures underneath the sails overall this is a nice ship but isnt big enough to be proportional to the figures fortunately this ship isnt nearly as tough to find as the tie defender and ewing and you can probably find one for a decent price|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its too bad this set is so hard to find the figures are all great depictions of force unleashed star galen marek theyre all well sculpted and painted the sith stalker is the most visually interesting a cruel mix between darth vader and starkiller the light side galens brown and white robes are a nice twist on the traditional brown jedi robes the plastic good and cloth sleeves work well the key figure is the galen in battle suit overall its a great figure but the ankle articulation is a bit limited preventing you from putting him into a runningaction pose if you can find this set for a decent price definitely get it|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its great to finally have some of the sith lords from the expanded universe i got this set particularly for darth bane who has become one of my favorite star wars characters ever after reading drew karpyshynspath of destruction kotor ii fans will also want to get darth nihilusthe darth bane accessories are probably not technically accurate according topath of destruction which describes banes robes as black also banes lightsaber is clearly red and is frequently described as having a hook like dookus but i like them anyway hasbro did a nice job of giving bane a purple color scheme with subtle purple highlights on the cape also his lightsaber is amethyst like mace windus the overall effect is to give bane a somewhat more exotic yet royal look which complements the otherwise ridiculouslooking orbalisks i have seen some fans repaint this figure black and give him a red lightsaber but then bane looks like just another dark jedi this is one case where hasbros mistake made for a visually more interesting figure i only wish they had taken more care with the orbalisks they are a seethrough yellowish plastic which isnt horrible but almost look a bit too bright also when you take the orbalisks off banes chest theres not much underneath  indeed he looks like he shed  poundsi havent played kotor ii so i cant comment too much on darth nihilus he looks like a sith with the creepy skull helmet the tattered cloth cape has a great effect flowing behind him in fact this is one of the few figures i wish had entirely cape clothing because i think it would have given the figure a real sense of formlessness as it stands this figure is great however my understanding was that nihilus was like a vacuum of dark energy this figure has dreadlocks under the hood which seems to imply that there was a man behind the mask i didnt like that touchand the darth maul figure do we really need another one this ones pretty good but with so many other great sith lords out there its a shame the third figure in the set is maul oh well|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is a nice set if you want to build up fighter squadrons and need more imperial pilots they all have removable helmets  with jango fetts face  and full articulation however be careful of overpaying for this set online especially if youre only looking for one of the figures also hasbro is releasing the tie fighter pilot separately later this summer so if you just want that one it probably better to wait for that one|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|given that there is already a vintage boba fett and a vintage jango fett on the way i pretty much got this set for mandalore the ultimate since this is the only place to find him he is a pretty cool figure especially for kotor fans with the rustic brown clothes and battle he really does look like a more ancient villain than the more modern fetts he has all the points of articulation one could want more importantly his accessories are awesome i already mentioned the battle axe which looks fearsome if you have him swinging it over his head mandalore also comes with a small shield with a strap which you can slip on his arm with all the articulation its pretty easy to set him up in dramatic poses say charging at revan and malak with his battle axe swinging overhead you can probably get mandalore separately via ebay or secondhand but the fetts are pretty good as well if you are looking for some more for your collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its definitely nice to get a group of rebel pilots the twilek female pilot is probably the highlight of the set her helmet is a unique design and fits really well the other two are good for dioramas and well done but not particularly interesting|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|none of these figures on their own are particularly amazing but theyre all pretty good the stormtroopers are some of the best ive seen the wookies seem a bit too big and chunky but the hair effect is well done id mostly recommend this set if you can find it for a good price as a setbuilder having extra wookies and stormtroopers is always good for a diorama|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been boba fett without his green armor  what a sight it definitely shows his origins as a cousin to the stormtroopers though  when put side by side boba blends in the figure itself is highly posable and has great detail|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i purchased this to go with the harley quinn deluxe and the poison ivy deluxe figures from tonner  i admit it was a bit of a disappointment compared to the other two dollsthe doll is quite high quality  a large articulated figure nearly twice the size of a barbie doll and much wider  the outfit is high quality as well  the clothing is layered and made of thick cotton  he comes with a green joker cane with a carved likeness of his head at the topi think the let down is the headface  its a bit too cartoony  scary even  my  year old wont even look at it and she loves the batman comics and animated series  somehow in d relief it comes across as a very disturbing display  unlike the harley and ivy which were created to look like ivy and harley in real life the joker is very cartoony looking its appropriate for the comics but just doesnt feel right when seen in d reliefthe hair is very stiff to hold that molded like shape  so it does stay in place but loses some of the realistic feel in the process unlike harley and ivy who have springy soft hair  jokers comes across as having been plastered hard in place from several cans of hair sprayin all i think this is one of the few regrets of purchases ive made from tonner  if you like your joker scary then likely this figure will greatly please you  as with all tonner dolls hes fully articulated and you can pose him in all kinds of wild and funny ways|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|necas teenage mutant ninja turtle figures are an awesome tribute to the original tmnt comics by kevin eastman and peter laird as per necas usual standards the figures are incredibly detailed and come loaded with articulation the turtles also have very detailed weapons baby turtles accessories and stands shaped as city streetsthese turtles are made in the style of the original tmnt comics the style and paint scheme are in the spirit of the original comics even down to the red bandanas and detailing on the shells as such the figures look like they just jumped off the page of one of the comics the stark contrast of black grit on the yellow plastrons and green bodies generally works well to highlight the detail the pictures i saw online dont do justice to how awesome these figures look in personas other reviewers have noted these arent really toys per se theyre primarily for collectors theyre not fragile but might break with rough play however these guys work beautifully for display the articulation means you can pose them in almost any action pose you want id be wary of twisting and turning the joints too much but the poses do hold wellunfortunately these figures are expensive and its tough to find them on the secondhand market however for diehard tmnt fans these guys are a must i did manage to score them for around  so its not impossible|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|jango was my first medicom figure eventhough i was always iffy on their  scale line medicoms face sculpts and paint tend to look less realistic than hot toyss and even sideshows but i loved how he looked in pictures so i went through with it last year i seemed to have bad luck with figures because again there was a problem with this one but thats due to medicoms poor quality controljango just comes with two extra hands and his blaster pistols his outfit looks outstanding and medicom really did a heck of a job with the tailoring and sculpting on the helmet jetpack and armor trust me when i say that he looks even better in person the face looks pretty good too in fact itd be perfect if they hadnt used an almost orangeish paint color on it this is one of medicoms better human sculpts and its too bad they didnt get the color right because it couldve been a perfect head and since jango uses the real action hero body the poseability is flawless the limbs arent too tight or loose and you can get any pose possible in real life and of course some crazy ones that even the best gymnast couldnt do i cant say enough good things about the rah bodyhowever the quality isnt all there the tubes on jangos arms come undone very easily and this is a common problem with each figure you can glue them back in place but they shouldve been properly secured in the first place so it wouldnt need to be fixed the blaster pistols are also cheaply made the ends of both of mine broke off in the box and had to be replaced as well my jango also had a crooked breastplate and that was beyond fixing since it meant potentially ruining the jumpsuit my main problem though is the helmet and putting it on theres only a very thin piece of tape on the inside on the face portion to protect jangos face from burring against it and losing paint its a tight fit i put the helmet on him twice and the nose was fine but silver paint rubbed onto his hair how hard would it have been for medicom to make the helmet be on a generic head and switch them that way one jango head and the other being a blank head with the helmet on it problem solved and itd justify the price they ask for these figuresjango is still a great addition to any collection just be aware that medicoms rah figures arent inscale with other  figure lines and if you plan on having him displayed with the sideshow star wars figures hell be a bit shorter by about half an inch|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|red xiii has always been one of my favorite character designs the red and orange colors flaming tail native american hair style and markings tattoos missing eyeeverything about this guy is rad and not over the top like many other ff characters are hes been one of the most soughtafter play arts figures for some time and is always selling for big bucks it got to the point where i didnt expect to own the figure because prices were going up so much but i managed to luck out and get one recently im glad i didnt give up on him this is easily one of the best figures ive ever ownedlet me repeat that for you one of the best figures ive ever owned as in every toy ive had since i was little even back when the huge megazords from power rangers were the beall of toysyou have to see red xiii for yourself to really see how great the sculpt and paint are nanaki looks absolutely perfect and easily tops the figure that came out in the late s this is the first play arts figure ive bought which might have been a mistake since the bar is so high now and others are going to have a tough time measuring upfirst up the articulation is phenomenal you can move the following his mouth head neck upper front legs lower front legs front paws upper back legs middle back legs lower back legs back paws tail each part moves easily though id be careful with the back legs as the ones on my red xiii feel much looser than the front legs even in the regular standing pose that you see in the stock picture above red looks awesome but you can get some nice action poses out of him too and if you have a good stand the number shoots up even more as i mentioned earlier the sculpt and paint are top notch with many little details sculpted into the figure especially in the hair areas both on his neck and head and those around his jaw reds flaming tail has a nice semitransparent appearance as well something i was pretty impressed by how often do you see a solid painted flame on a figure instead of one like thisincluded with red is cait sith a nicely sculpted figure in its own right cait sith can be posed nicely but is pretty limited because of his size you can move his head arms hands legs boots and tail around he also comes with an alternate right hand to swap out with the hand that holds his megaphone cait sith can stand up on his own or sit atop red xiii for a nice displayof all the play arts figures that ive seen inperson i have to say that red xiii definitely stands out as one of the best and is very much worth the money at the same time its clear that its a fragile figure and we all know that the play arts line has a bit of a problem with limbs breaking off and not staying on im going to be extra careful with my figure because of that especially since this figures practically extinct theres a reason why the others from volume  are still easily found for regular prices while red is  times as much buy this figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember the excitement when hasbro released this figure in the late s  the first rebel fleet trooper ever the sculpt is still pretty realistic if on the muscular side however there have been better versions including the incredible new  vintage version if you want to get a few rebel fleet troopers id recommend spending your money on those ones first|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|of course when luke first saw the millennium falcon he exclaimed what a piece of junk i had the opposite reaction when i first saw this ship its absolutely gorgeous the sculpt and paint job on the hull are nearly perfect unlike with the older versions hasbro doesnt require you to use decals for the hull so it looks extremely realistic more importantly its huge measuring almost  feet long which is over  larger than either the potf or otc versions while its not quite scale with the typical  figure its not too far off either the falcon comes loaded with lots of other features from the lightup hyperdrive looks great in the dark to a boarding ramp that declines at the press of a buttoni will just make a few recommendations and one area where this nearly perfect vehicle could be improved first it seems a lot of people have complained about the landing gear i havent had a problem so far however you do have to be a bit careful because the instructions arent very clear about how to put them in certain pieces go into certain slots if you do it correctly the landing gear should stay in finesecond the interior of the ship does require decals its not too bad and for the most part theyre easy to apply however if hasbro were ever to redo this ship  not that they have to  id recommend getting rid of the decals altogether and just sculpting and painting the buttons and gear in the interior although im sure thatll be more difficult itd probably look fantasticif you loved star wars loved han and chewie and the millennium falcon this is probably going to be the definitive version of the falcon if you get no other star wars toy in your life make sure its this one you wont be sorry|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|when i opened it i realized it was huge once assembled length  inches  cm width  inches  cm  you really need a table to keep it  it is not something you could put in a small closet and for people in a small appartment it could mean a real problem  the fact is that it is the biggest toy for a shelf i have ever seen in my life  i had seen the old kenner version once and it was not impressive but this one isi thought the newest version of atat that was  inches  cm tall was big but this is way bigger  you see the pictures and you know it is big but it is not until you open it that you realize how huge it isissuesi was concerned about all the comments about legs not properly in place but i found that i had no problems  it is like the monkey game of fitting shapes into holes as pin sizes are different and it also has some shapes under the pin so you can put the leg where it belongs  so landing gear did not suck as some reviews suggested landing gear is not an issue it would detach if you have it on the floor and you try to move it sideways so instead of breaking landing gear would detach  it is about  kilograms too heavy and big to have a kid moving it around and flying  so it is better as a landed playset and the landing gear will show no problems for that roleit is a toy that requires assistance from an adult the manual does not tell you how to open the top cover and how to open the minivehicle canopy  i had to figure it out myself hoping not to break it  fortunately i did notit is a great playset for kids but try not to let small accesories to be close to some places where they could fall and you may need to disassemble the toy as it may fall too deep inside  there is a small hole near the medic bay and try not to store small accesories in the hyperdrive compartment eitherthe dejarik star wars chess table does not allow enough room between the seat and the table  so chewies legs must point somewhere else  the best version of cpo is the star wars  saga legends action figure sl no  that has knee articulations alse it will not be able to sit down a play chessfitting action figures in the seats require some time  since many star wars action figures are unable to sit down seats will be useless for those  it is a bit difficult to fit action figures in those seats anywayprobably all these issues come from trying to fit all these elements in a small area as the falcon is still not as big as the sets in the moviethe addition of a minifighter instead of the top hatch where lando rescued luke was a wierd choice  it may add playability for a kid but it somehow reminds me the escape pod used in the movie alienthe falcon does not include the accesories like the helmet for saber training the hand accessory for luke in the medical bay and since i already had ben and luke from bluray commemorative pack i will not buy the battle pack training on the falcon as paying  for some masks and a helmet is just too much  i miss those accesories but i will not pay  for the battle pack training on the falcon that has themnone of the issues is bad enough to make me not to feel this is a great product way bigger and better than i imaginedprosi loved the ramp mechanism  push a button and it opens smoothly like in the movie while it plays a soundthe laser cannon below the ship used when escaping hoth was a nice additioni loved the lights sounds and voices as it brings this toy to lifestickers and sculpted details to make it much more movie accurate is a great thingall the functionality it has all around in such a small area is just amazing as a work of engineering this toy is an outstanding job  it must have been a real challenge to design this toyit is impressive even for non star wars fans  an old lady i know said as a joke she would ask me for divorce if i was married to her and i had spent that money to buy a toy  but as she saw it she loved it and stepped back on what she saidit is the perfect doll house for star wars fans  and it is even bigger than a barbie doll houseit is the best star wars ship in my collectionif hasbro will continue making toys that big i will need to buy a museum just to have a place to store them  i want to congratulate the makers of this fantastic toy  you really amazed me for this  well the new vintage version of the falcon is a repack of this deluxe ship with no action figures included and if you feel two action figures are not worth  difference in pricing you better go for the new vintage version of millenium falcon and not the deluxe version|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|there are so many things i love about this version of scrabble  first of all the spots for the letters are recessed so the letters are held in place more securely  you dont bump them out of place while putting other letters on the board  i also love how the board swivels and folds in half to become a portable storage system for all the pieces  this is so great  i am really glad i bought it|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i wouldnt say this is a close likeness of the actress in the movie but it is a lovely doll nonetheless  the shirt is nicely stitched and does match the star trek movie costume  the star fleet badge is a separate plastic piece and not just a patch or painted onto the shirt itself  the pattern of the star fleet logo on the dress is painted on rather than a texture  but it doesnt feel to cheap from being so  the undershirt is only a small piece and not a full shirt  it would have been nice for a pink label product to at least have a full undershirt underneath  her boots are solid vinyl and not molded on so they are removable which is a nice touch  she wears small gold earrings and comes with a phaser that is nicely detailedin all a highly recommended collector item that looks just as good outside of the box as in|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a very nice star trek doll though it does suffer in comparison to the kirk and uhura barbies  spocks shirt is nicely deatiled with piping around the edges and the star fleet pattern texture though this is painted on and not a part of the weave  the star trek communicator logo is d and not a patch or painted on item  the military braiding at the cuffs is also nicely detailed looks like braiding and sewn in separately for a more realistic feel though it lacks the texture detail of kirks  the pants are sewn with extra details that specifically match the costume in the movie  they arent just brown pants  the communicator and tricorder are also well done  the molded vinyl boots also carry quite a bit of detailthe dolls likeness to the movie character is fine but perhaps missing some of the directness of the movie character  his hair is very stiff unlike the kirk dolland looks more like a helmet even though it is rooted hair as with the other dolls the undershirt is not separate and just sewn in at the top  i would have liked to see a full undershirt underneathoddest of all the way the hair is stiff and cut makes the ears look rounded  im going to need to take some small trimmers to the hair to make the pointy ears stand out because the doll looks like a human and not a vulcan  i would have liked the ears to stand out away from the head rather than being molded solid against itin all id rate this an excellent dollcharacter  suitable for both boys and girls it definitely doesnt feel like a barbie doll|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a lovely doll for the adult collector  lots of detail sewn into the outfit and a beautiful modern face paint  i love that mattel chose to do a modern gothic line of dolls  sexy and mysteriousas with most of the barbie collector dolls she has solid legs that are not bendable  since shes meant for display and not play thats fine these dolls are meant to be displayed on a stand  but unlike the cheap barbies the legs arent holly and dont knock aroundthe quality of her costume is amazing  she has a raw musline undershirtchemise with lace edging at the collar  the  sleeves are also capped with black lace and delicate ribbons matching the garters on her stockings  a black velvet corset has lovely lace up ribbons that are tied at the top in a bow  i really like that the ribbons are scaleappropriate for the size of the doll  she has a very interesting puffy skirt with tartan details  the skirt is sewn to the musline undershirtbodysuit and not really meant to be removed for play over the outfit is the fourth layer  a red cape with a rolled up hood  interestingly the hood doesnt open  it is rolled and stuffed her hair goes over the top of it  and of course she has the fishnets with lace at the top and redblack shoes  on the inside of her cape is a barbie collector labeli think the only distraction is that the skirt does not fit well on my doll  its too big and bulkyher hair is long in back with a loose curl at the ends  she comes with a basket full of goodies appropriate for a forest rompthe wolf doll is about half the size and equally if not better made  im not a fan of the plastic head  i do wish it was a ken doll with a removable wolf mask  but other than the plastic soft vinyl really head on the wolf i really love this setas with all barbie collector dolls it is intended and priced for the adult collector  and i think the adult collector will love her|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of my favorite of the barbie collector dolls  i was so surprised when they released this as a subject for a barbie doll  its definitely not for kids and kind of scary  but the box is beautifully designed and you really get a feel for the movie from it  i havent taken it out of the box but i am very happy i purchased this and it is displayed right next to my computer|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|i went allin with my international playthings rocket purchase so that meant buying the space base too or space base  as its calledthe space base like the moon buggy that pulls it has rubber wheels that ensure it rolls smoothly  unfortunately the little hook that connects the buggy to the base is not very sturdy so a strong enough push ends up easily disconnecting the two vehicles  my son doesnt roll the base around much as a resultthe space buggy has a shovel connected to it that clicks upward or downward  this makes it slightly top heavy so that it falls over easily  putting an astronaut or the robot in it helps balance it outthe space base itself opens across the top with the lower flap acting as steps and the upper flap as a solar panel  it sounds ingenious until you see the mechanism to openclose the base in action  its flimsy and very difficult for little hands to open and close  i have to do it for my son who gets annoyed when he cant close it himselfinside the base is a laptop and a screen with an astronaut presumably from rocket  talking  my son finds this to be the most interesting part of the basethe astronauts are green and blue and theres a robot helper thrown in for good measure  the robot is the same size as the astronauts so you know what that means  hell be driving the space buggy while the astronauts kick back in the base for a napunlike the rocket the space base has limited functionality  you roll it around and you openclose it  and it does both poorly  with no special effects noises or lights no cool alien and a flimsy door this toy is better suited for older kids three years at least who can operate it|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i love the idea behind this its so seldom that we see anything regarding ralph mcquarries concept art for the original star wars these figures are a great representation of what might have been i have to say i like this version of the rebel trooper better than the version that appeared in the movie the figure itself is highly posable and has great detail the helmet even comes off definitely worth adding to your collection|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this was actually one of the better barbie toys  after mariposa whose wings never stayed on or worked the elephant from island princess which never caught one of the girls with its trunk and was boring or even princess ro whose peacock feathers never stayed on this seems to be holding up well  and seems to be really enjoyed for beyond a single day by my daughterthe play value is there  if you jiggle the horse in the air it prompts a flying sound there is a little button at the bottom of a hoof so that if you push down on the horse the button is pressed and the horse makes clip clop noises  if you push its mouth open it sounds like it is eating and will eventually make a sound like it doesnt like more and if you leave it alone after playing with it it will make sleeping noises unfortunately as with all barbie toys there is always something that doesnt work  in the case of brushing it with the comb its supposed to make happy noises it doesnt sense when you are combing and my  year old has to yank on the hair to get that particular sound out and i really mean yank  which im not sure i like encouraging her to do to any animal  the horse also randomly plays the connected song and lights up prettilyid highly recommend this toy if only it wasnt so expensive  and lets be honest here there are a lot more toys that might be more interesting or educational than this one and for a lot cheaper  i would expect this to be priced around  to be a decent choice for a good toy value and productand surprisingly i would have liked for better product placement in the video  this character is not in the dvd other than in the background being turned to stone with another horse behind two minor characters  when i bought the horse i had thought there would have at least been a scene in the dvd that my daughter could relate to  but she asks me where is the glimmer horsie in the movie and then asks which of the two horses in the background is glimmer  and i cant tell i had thought one of the main characters would have at least rode or been given the horse  the grapes that it eats seem pretty random  perhaps glimmer is in a book or other story place|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this comes with quite a few little pieces making it perhaps not as fun as other barbie dolls  i really wish mattel would clue in and include some kind of small bag or purse for the doll to carry all her junk in  otherwise these all just end up lost or underfoot all the timeits a lovely doll and the hair is thick and full  but youll probably lose  of the accessories within the first three days|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this doll is very beautiful  one of the nicest and sweetest looking in the barbie fantasy line  i really like that her tail is vinyl and not hard plastic like previous mermaid dolls  because it is vinyl she bends at the knees and that allows for even more posingdefinitely one of the best barbies for little girls who like fantasy style dolls|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i like this toy  it is a cute train that will move even on carpet when a lot of toys wont  i also like that you can play with the animals individually as well  my only complaint is that the train doesnt stay together when you pick it up to put away  i just had to put the animals next to each other on a shelf  you cant leave it connected  it falls apart when picked up  its a great toy in spite of that though|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this is a great toy with so many great learning activities that it makes it worth the money  this comes with some accessories though that i think are totally pointless  you get a little table and chairs that the two figures cant even sit at and a car that they dont even fit in  one doesnt even fit by itself  i dont even get these out with the toy when my kids play with it  this is a great toy but the extras arent needed at all|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|bunearys a pokemon my daughters wanted for a few months but since she was part of an older wave it was only available online and overpriced like most older mini plush but now bunearys come back as part of the newest wave of mini plush and we got one the minute we saw it at the store but once i really got a look at it buneary didnt look all that cute to me the design of the pokemon in the games and animated series is cute of course but the translation to plush formehlike most of the mini plush from the last couple of waves buneary is extremely wellmade and theres not a single thing on her that could easily be torn off the head arms and feet are made of the usual material i think its fleece mini plush pokemon are made of and the body and ear fuzzies are poofy if youve ever seen a plush sheep or lamb thats exactly the look they were going for hereand it doesnt look that great i dont know if its just because its a different material or what but this buneary looks like it was put together from two different stuffed animals it just looks weird when you have it in your hand ill put up a picture in the customer images above so you can see for yourself buneary also cant stand up on her own which isnt a big deal since a lot of mini plush pokemon cant but ive met some people who refuse to buy them if they cant stand up on their own believe it or not her eyes eyebrow dots nose mouth and pink pads on her feet are sewn in i dont care for the super wide smile shes sporting if it were trimmed down by even  itd look better but thats just meif you or your child are huge fans of buneary id go with the bigger talking plush over this one since it looks better but not by much my daughter loves this version and thats all that matters in the end but i collect some of these myself and i gotta say that poor buneary is one of the worst ive seen in a long time great quality but it just looks off|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy consists of animals with wheels and a little rattling penguin that you put on a platform so you can watch them spin around  i dont think thats worth the price at all  my kids love the little animals but wouldnt touch the platform part  basically i payed a lot of money for  rolling animals and a penguin rattle  the songs this thing plays are really annoying as well  i think they should skip the rest of this toy and just sell the rolling animals for a cheaper price  they are cute and kids really do like them  i would save my money and just get my kid something else  the animals already have wheels  i dont know why they need to be spinning around on a platform anyway|ham
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i didnt like these cards because they were double sided but only had textured patches on one side which means half of the numbers have nothing  i also didnt like that there was only one patch to feel instead of the number featured on the card  if the card says  there should be  patches to count  i was not impressed|ham

A2WS6FMF750EI9|with all due respect to the positiverating reviewer i saw nothing on the box that proclaimed that the wings were removable we purchased this doll because we had such a horrendous time with her leader mariposa well lets just say that she is not much better her wings broke off after circa two months you can cover the semidangerous spike that is left protruding out of her back with the dolls hair or you can throw her in the trash so she can eventually be pecked at by a rather dirty seagull at your local landfill which is the fate that she deserves|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|diamond select has had some spotty quality control issues in the past my original enterprise had a few problems including a black saucer dish however i got this enterprise d today and im stunned i love it its about the same size as the old playmates one but much more detailed the ship looks great and to my eye at least ive spotted few problems the lights are very bright and its not just the warp engines that light up  the impulse engines deflector dish and bridge do too it might not be model quality but if youre short on time and can spend around  dollars this is a perfect item for any tng fanive seen other reviews complain about the stand just using one stand to support the entire ship is a bit risky because the stand is pretty thin and wobbly however theres a simple trick to make it work out well the instructions recommend using the taller stand for the battle section and the smaller one for the saucer however if you reverse those two you can actually use both stands to support the enterprise this gives it extra support and also allows you to pose the enterprise in a lot of neat positionsim not a huge fan of having a bunch of quotes for sound effects the captain picard voice is passable but what id really like is more ship sounds like phasers torpedoes etc thats one thing playmates got right and diamond select still hasnt really learnedthe only real problem i have with the enterprise d is that its lonely the other diamond select ships other than the enterprise e arent in scale diamond select needs to make a romulan warbird or klingon vorcha cruiser to keep it company|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|bobby jacksons really outdone himself with this sculpt a figure that leaves no doubt as to who he is this is a highlevel knight wielding a holy sword he obviously belongs to some warrior cult of female angels as depicted on his shield  and oh yeah his sword is on firealmaran isnt wearing a helmet the more to show off his dashing good looks his armor is beautifully detailed with another angels head and wings on his breastplate  if you have any sort of goodaligned fighter wielding a flaming sword this is the miniature for you i painted almaran blue and gold but my poor painting skills simply arent up to the task of doing it justicethe only downside is that almaran pretty much commits  if your character doesnt have a flaming sword hes not going to be of much use  and if i know adventurers the hold on to flaming swords for a few levels before they move on to something else  still if you paint the flames a different color perhaps gold and silver i didnt think of this when i painted him the sword could easily be a holy avenger  in which case almaran is truly a force to be reckoned with|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this is a great toy  my kids love it  it is colorful and the music isnt irritating like some toys  you have to reset the trains before they will pop out again but that is just part of toys like this  you have to do that with all of the popup toys i have seen  besides it isnt hard to do and my yearold can by herself so it causes me no problems  this would be great for any kid that loves thomas or trains in general|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a nice game that is easy for young ones to play  no dice or counters  just simple memory game and matching  and thats why i rated it at  stars instead of   its just a bit too simplethe game play is simple  you have one set of cards middle layer with dinosaur bone pieces on them  these fit together to assemble  of four dinosaurs you place those face down and then put a top layer larger card on top of each of the them  the top layer cards have little notches in them so you can use the excavator tool to life up the top layer and then secretly peek at a middle layer card  if the piece is for your dinosaur you take that middle layer  if it is someone elses dinosaur part you put it back  you keep going until someone assembles their dinosaur about  cards per dinosaur  there are ruby cards let you take an extra turn and snake cards you flip up an extra top layer and whosoever dinosaur part it is you give to them  the way this works it is much more fun with  players than it is with just   with only two players if someone flips up a middle layer card and its not theirs they put it back and thats an obvious tip off to the other player that the piece is for their dinosaur  which makes it kind of unchallengingi guess the easy way to describe this is that it is similar to a preschool memory game but changed to resemble a dinosaur bone hunt game play takes about  minutes or so and there are a lot of pieces since there are the larger top layer cards and then the smaller middle layer cards  if you lose a card it severely affects the game so you need to be very careful with thisfor educational purposes the back side of the top layer cards all have dinosaur facts  but with only  of those cards those facts get exhausted pretty soon  and with only  dinosaurs to get the bone pieces of theres not a lot of depth of play or learning  each of the dinosaur piece cards is lined by a color making it easy for kids of all ages to know immediately whether the card goes with their dinosaurin all a nice game but definitely for the very young dino lover|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|after hearing nothing but positive things about necas ninja turtles figures i had to go and get one to see what the fuss was about on a couple of toy collecting sites these guys won awards for being the best figures that came out when they were released neca usually does a good job on the sculpting of their figures but more often than not theyre ministatues and dont have much in the articulation department well guess what these tmnt figures are the ultimate tmnt figures and any fan needs to pick these up before they go up in price yet againmy review covers the original donatello figure that came on a card not the one that comes in a plastic tube or with the other turtles the carded one comes with extra accessories that make him an even better figure than he already is donatello has articulation everywhere and basically any pose that he did in the cartoons or comic you can recreate shoulders elbows wrists waist thighs knees feet and head this guys got it all just be sure to not overdo it because the joints on mine got loose after a few months because id keep getting him in cool poses for photography and the joints arent anywhere near as tight as they originally were the sculpting on this figure is fantastic though all  turtles use the same body sculpt only the head is different because of the facial expressions but everything looks perfect it really does look like they took a d image from the comic and turned that exact image into a d figure just look at the little black specks here and there on him he practically looks like an illustration neca also did a great job with the paint on these and mine didnt have any slop at allaccessorieswise don comes with his bo which separates on one end where the tape starts this makes it easier to get in his hands since the grip on both is tight he also comes with a baby turtle sewer base ooze canister and two extra hands with ninja climbing spikes on the palms these hands swap out with the closed bo hands easily and these ones are in a more open position like hed use for climbing these hands add even more pose possibilities to the figureare there any cons with this guy yeah the price these figures sold very well when they first came out and were still easily available until about a year ago now theyre going for three times as much not cool and i cant say just one of these is worth that price but if you can get one for half of that its well worth it otherwise there really isnt a single bad thing to say about this figure its perfect the sculpt and articulation make it look awesome on the shelf and kids can actually play with it|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|beautiful little set but expensive for what you get my daughter has other sets as well and the catdog bling as well as the child bling has not held up too well also a leatherpossibly pleather leash has already ripped in half thats the best way that i can put it the toy included with misty was nothing other than a fuzzy craft ball obtainable at any walmart the purses are great the included blanket is cozy but boring no pepjazz to em the dish is very regal misty herself is elegant and finely made the mag that comes along with the set is too careeroriented for my taste and although i came across an article on the web that referenced a book that blasts the mag for portraying these critters as being too imageconscious i have not seen any ill effects in my daughters psyche as of yet wish that these sets came with at least one outfit or a bed and that they were not partially poorly made get the smaller set my daughter was just as happy with that one as she was with this bigger set|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i bought this for my  year old  she has a hard time getting the hands in the right place to make the doll actually do the dancing  i had to read the directions and even then it took a few tries to figure it outits a very vanilla doll  decently presented but perhaps missing a bit of the barbie quality  but for the price it is what it is  i do recommend it for older than  though  my daughter isnt uncoordinated but still has trouble actually making it dance|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|of all the hm singing dolls i like this one best  the styling is quite nice and her hair seems to hold up much better than the other dolls  but as with the other dolls she is quite loud  a nice feature of the jakks hm dolls is that you can press the button again and she stops singing immediately  weve used that feature quite a bitif you only want to get  hm singing dolls this really is your best choice i also like that they didnt have her saying miscellaneous phrases inbetween the song playing oh niblets in a different hm doll is irritating after  times|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|along with the other hannah dolls the clarity of the song is fine and not really too loud or too soft  my  year old loves to dance and sing along with it  shes had a lot of use with it and it hasnt broken|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i would definitely buy this doll at  but she seems a bit high priced above that for what you get  i honestly have tried many different ways to get the dancing feature mechanism to work and honestly all you do is twist the doll oddly and the arms flail  perhaps not the most interest of accessories for a doll as a result  the clothes are bland but serviceableits lacking the charm and quality of a barbie doll  so id rate this as a disposable toy best bought when the price is under  and if your child doesnt have any of the more interesting singing versions|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|ive been playing this with my  year old and we love it  it is much more fun and less frustrating than regular yahtzee  the game is about rolling dice to try to get a card eg  of a kind s etc  or to steal a card that an opponent just won a previous turn if no card is stolenrolled then you use chips to add up they add up fast on harder cards such as  of a kind  making it a trump if you roll a  of a kind on your turn  what makes this fun is that with each roll and each player gets  rolls on their turn you can go for one of the three cards on the board or try to steal an opponents card  so there are very few wasted turns as there are with regular yahtzeealso of note is the beautiful presentation of this game  it has a fancy fold up board that turns into the box bottom  the top is lined in flocked paper so you have a rolling surface that is contained  the board has special holders for your dice from each turn and the storage box is flocked also  even the instructions are beautifully presented in a special die cut fold out  its ironic you cant see just how interesting this is from the outside of the boxin all ive never really liked yahtzee but i greatly enjoyed this game  the presentation and play are first rate fun and it is something that is good for a wide range of ages eg if you have a family of  of different ages they can all play together equally with no advantage for someone being older|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this game goes by a lot faster than the original but it is still fun  we play this as a family and enjoy it  we have tried all four different games you can play and like them all equally  i like the original better but this is a nice change sometimes|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i was one of the stupid ones to ignore the where the wild things are line of figures by mcfarlane when they came out ages ago while the book is a cherished classic in my life and i was a big toy collector at that time i just never got around to picking them up instead i payed a pretty penny for each one over the last year were they worth it absolutely i havent felt so happy opening a package for something that i knew what was inside getting to hold a wild thing figure let alone seeing it inperson made me feel like i was  years old again these figures are masterpieces and goes to show you how great mcfarlane used to befirst things first this figure looks exactly like moishe it has the ink scratch look all over and the colors are perfect attention to detail is something i really appreciate and mcfarlane didnt hold back in that department each hair scale and even every groove in his claws is there i didnt think an illustration could be converted to a figure so flawlessly but heres proof that it can be done moishe is a pretty solid heavy figure and could hurt you if dropped on your foot he has articulated arms legs and his tail can move around too he comes with a little patch of grass that acts as a stand which youll need if you want any of these figures to stand up at all when putting him on the stand i had to move the tail down a little so it acted as a third leg and guaranteed that he wouldnt be falling oversadly none of these figures are that strong despite being heavy and solid they break very easily i bought another moishe for my daughter to have and his tail broke off as did an arm its not her fault either the limbs on these figures arent fastened very well if they were thered probably be no articulation though i wouldnt mind that as long as it meant no breaking be very careful when moving his limbs around and take extra care with the stand it has a peg that goes into the bottom of his foot and i know a lot of people have accidentally broken that peg when taking the figure offwhile the prices of these figures hit the roof once the movie started to get more hype early last year i feel theyre worth up to three ben franklins each this line was only out for a little while and that was a long time ago now and trust me you dont want to be stuck with the medicom vcd figures i reviewed two of those and ended up selling them being happy with my mcfarlane set get these guys while you still can|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|this is one head knocker ive wanted for a while as soon as i found out that neca made one of frank he was at the top of my list for most wanted bobbleheads the design isnt super detailed like some of the other head knockers out there but ill be damned if it isnt just plain charming having this guy on the shelf along with the others adds even more diversity to my collection really going from the stay puft marshmallow man to stripe to slimer to the hulk toa pug in a suit yes this little guy stands out despite being so basicfranks made out of the same resin as all the other head knockers but feels hollow hes one of my bigger ones but is much lighter than stripe or stay puft he looks just like he does in the stock picture with no changes made from the prototype to the final product frank sits on a silver base with the miib logo ready for his next task despite being a basic dog sculpt they did a good job adding some details like wrinkles in the hind legs like a real dog would have when sitting down the suit looks good though again its pretty standard in terms of design the part where this guy shines is the head sculpt it looks like a real pug complete with the bugged out eyes the bobble feature on him is very good and his head shakes all over the place but theres some danger of chipping because the bottom of the head is very thin and if his head moves too much and hits the neck peg it could break some pieces off but most people who get these will be carefulthe only con as with all neca products the paint is hit or miss my frank has great paint on the head but the suit is messy with black from the jacket going onto the white shirt same with the tie luckily it wasnt too bad but if you care about getting a really good one check pictures before buying if you canfrank isnt going for very much these days so hes a good deal at the current price im happy with him|spam

have any problemsmy critiquei had to stop myself from reading the prior negative reviews because i get so frustrated and flabbergasted where are some people coming from really people this thing has not changed from when i used it and that was about thirty years ago gasp it is not called the easy bake oven for nuthin this baby is truly easy to use it was inducted into the national toy hall of fame no small feat there i love spending time with my kids while reliving my childhood and piggin out what can be betterpsi will one day read all of the heartbreaking negative reviews in order to disperse accurate info to the masses please do not misunderstand me i just feel that some reviews are written out of sheer furious revenge because we become grizzlies when we or our kids are disappointed call me crazy i have decided to give the easy bake a pro bono defense please see the charges listed below with my defense arguments following each charge emanation of a plastic burning odor upon engaging oventhis is not due to plastic parts burning within the oven it is the foodgrade oil evaporating child gagging upon opening and smelling powdered mixpossible inhalation of product working timer not a product featurea general household timer can be utilized presence of working timer on oven can provide an educational opportunity in learning to tell timea nondigital clock would actually provide a better lesson in learning to tell time digital is fine for learning time management  and for learning how to read numbers  oven should include upgraded silicone panssilicone pans are not cost efficient for hasbro metal pans are more homey pan placement and removal from oven is difficultthis may be so if you have physical limitations it did not seem difficult to me although i am an adult i am sure that hasbro has gone through numerous trials in order to affirm that an eightyearold and up can perform these above actions light bulb cooking method is strangethis is how chestnuts were roasted by nyc street vendors in the early s this was the inspiration for the ebo also this strange method works children require adult supervision with this ovenyes what a pity children sometimes do require supervision one reviewer stated that it was easier for her children to use a real oven implying that they use a real oven alonenow thats a crazy situation with a real oven even more supervision is needed mixes are not the same as the big name brand mixesyes they basically are just compare the ingredients using the ebo involves a lot of workhow is it any more work than baking with a real oven it is the same process just kiddifiedminiaturized oven only allows a small amount of batter to be baked during a cyclethis product is aimed at children plus this is all the oven is capable of baking at one time if youre looking for larger amounts i suggest calling your local bakery if you have a larger brood waiting for the goods tell them to wait or clean up the kitchen for ten to fifteen minutes if they can wait for you to get off of facebook then they can wait for a cake an aside here i think that the small cakescookies are charming bulbs are not included with the ovenbulbs are delicate items that could possibly break during transport of the ovens hasbro does not want a lawsuit due to a brokenbulblaceration upon opening their product hey batteries do not come with other toys so whats the problem they have to be purchased separately as well my daughter was disappointed when told that we had to get a bulb for the oven we had a huge snowstorm at the time and she ended up waiting for at least two weeks for us to get a bulb she lived bulbs are hard to findthey are at your local lowes walmart and target we live in a rural area and we have the aforementioned retailers nearby oven used two bulbs during one baking cyclereviewer did not state condition or wattage of bulbs that she used she reported that they were already in her home and implied that they were used she still gave the oven a negative rating mixes do not come with instructionseither the reviewer did not check the box of mixes thoroughly or she did not realize that the directions for the recipes directly follows the directions for the oven in general see booklet that comes with oven it is entirely possible that a hasbro employee was daydreaming about paneras and forgot to drop the instructions in the box of mixes before sealing preparation takes too long reviewer plugged in oven for warmup after prepum you can prep while the oven is warming up using this oven commits one to a long projectdoes the person who made this statement ever bake with her own oven note about fortyfive minutes for my ebo process fifteen minutes for each of the following actions prep doing dishes while the oven is baking puttting back supplies while cakescookies are cooling it could even take less time than that it is so easy batter does not reach the top of the provided panwhen making a nonebo cake one does not fill the batter to the top edge of a standard adult baking pans the ebo does not teach children how to bakeyes it actually does just in a simplified way and what eightyearold needs to know how to make a serious cake anyway theres time for that in the future the ebo created a blue surge from plug to socket when plugging in and is therefore dangerousthis is basically an overloaded circuit and its the red surge that is dangerous not the blue my dad is an electrical engineer ebos were recalled in that was a recall roundup in  top ten wanted dangerous toys the ebos that were recalled were the frontloading ones not the types that are being used and reviewed on amazon presently the frontloading ones were first recalled in january  children can put hands inside of ovenof course they can they can also put their hand inside of a real oven as well but are people complaining about that basic kitchen appliance if your kid is not the rulefollowing type do not give him this oven a reviewer had to give her child the false advertising talk due to the fact that cakescookies came out of the oven in an unsatisfactory state ieitthey did not look like the baked goods on the box thus gave the oven a negative reviewfirstly this is not false advertisementit is a legal dirty facet of the advertising world if her daughter is as bright and as independent as the reviewer stated then her child should be ready to handle this subject ive been telling my kid  about the above subject for about a year and a half now and it has not given me or her a nervous breakdown my kid also noticed that our end results did not look professional i knew from past experience that the end results were not going to be stunning we were just having fun not trying to

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i havent gotten star wars figures in a while but when i saw a new version of thrawn i couldnt resist overall id say this version of thrawn and talon karrde are definitely well painted and detailed thrawn looks a lot scarier than the  version thrawns jacket comes down over and is separate from the legs and of course theres never been a karrde before i didnt really know how to imagine karrde before but his goatee and drab vest and clothes i think are a good fitunfortunately since my last star wars figures it seems hasbro has begun adding more articulation to the figures i personally dont like this the points of articulation on the elbows and armpits are glaringly obvious moreover the limbs have small numbers printed on them in the same color as the paint so theyre hardly visible but still i can understand making a superarticulated version of anakin skywalker or han solo for kids to play with but for figures like these that will end up mostly on collectors shelves i think the articulation just undermines the overall ambience of the figure the almost look like gi joe figuresthese figures are easily  stars and would be perfect if they had fewer or better disguised articulation points definitely recommended for fans of the heir to the empire series|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|there hasnt been a figure version of prince xizor sinceshadows of the empire star warsfirst came out in the mids thats a shame and im very glad hasbro remedied that by putting out a great new version of xizor first things first this xizor can stand unlike the prior version which notoriously could not stand because of the plastic cape this one stood right out of the package  almost no manipulation required also the paint sculpt and articulation are all wonderful i particularly like the color tones with subdued yellows and purples running throughout it really gives the air of royalty where the previous figure just looked like a big bullyi took a star off of this set because the leia figure is horrible this set should have been the ideal time to make a figure of guri xizors sexy android aid or a new dash rendar instead the leia is ugly with thick legs an unrealistic face and a shawl that doesnt stay clipped on given the price this set is worth getting for xizor alone but it could have been even better|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|i was one of the contributors to reaper miniatures bones kickstarter and they finally arrived last month im now on a journey to paint most of them and as i finish each miniature i plan to review it i am by no means a professional painter but i do try to spend time on detailcassie female gnome wizard is an excellent sculpt by wener klocke  klockes work is uniformly excellent and this gnome caster is no exception  she wears a buttondown trench coat and wields a staff tipped by a gemstone  she also has a scroll case on her right hip and a potion bottle on her left cassie even has a tiny ring on one finger this is an adventurer who has been aroundthe back of the figure is equally interesting  cassies hair is in a long braid and it ends in a key ring  the end of the staff is a gear complementing the gnomish theme of clockworks  as is typical with reaper photos cassie is a small figure so painting the details right is not easy  i particularly enjoyed painting cassies hair and nails and lipstick bright pink  a hallmark of a good sculpt like this is that you want to play a character inspired by it and cassie is definitely perky enough to put in a campaignfemale gnome sculpts are pretty rare and this one is worthy of adding to your collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the imperial engineers didnt receive much time onscreen in the original trilogy but they stuck out because of their distinctive helmets and nononsense attitudes this figure is a wonderful replica of these guys and frankly the best job hasbro has done with any imperial officer thus far its largely a repaint of thestar wars  the saga collection basic figure death star gunner but the paint color scheme for this one is more distinctive and accentuates the detail also the helmet and vest come off  obviously something that never happened in the movie but nonetheless neat|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|necas teenage mutant ninja turtle figures are an awesome tribute to the original tmnt comics by kevin eastman and peter laird as per necas usual standards the figures are incredibly detailed and come loaded with articulation the turtles also have very detailed weapons baby turtles accessories and stands shaped as city streetsthese turtles are made in the style of the original black and white comics neca decided to do something really bold and actually make the figures black and white with the same tones as the original comics as such the figures look like they just jumped off the page of one of the original comics the stark contrast of black and white generally works well to highlight the detail the pictures i saw online dont do justice to how awesome these figures look in personas other reviewers have noted these arent really toys per se theyre primarily for collectors theyre not fragile but might break with rough play however these guys work beautifully for display the articulation means you can pose them in almost any action pose you want id be wary of twisting and turning the joints too much but the poses do hold wellunfortunately these figures are expensive and its tough to find them on the secondhand market however for diehard tmnt fans these guys are a must i did manage to score them for around  signed by kevin eastman no less so its not impossible|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of my least favorites in the dolls of the world series  her dress is a very cheap satin and the detailing is not nearly as nice as other dolls the lace is the cheap stuff you find on underwear the hat is especially cheap looking and poor quality and the dress is not full as the box makes it look  in fact theres nothing under the cheap satin of the dress at all so it looks really flat right out of the box  in fact it comes out of the box perfectly folded in half and never really fluffs out at all  the dress is made to be permanently uplifted  it would have been nice if it could have been made such that it looked like she was actually flipping it upwards rather than having it illogically defy gravity on its ownthe doll herself is quite lovely and the hair is nicely styled  the shoes and stockings are also nice  one benefit of taking it out of the box is that her feather can stand up to full height and add to the costume  but honestly i dont like looking at this doll much because her outfit and especially the hat look so cheaply made and designedone complaint is that the satin of the dress is so cheap that the tabs used to hold it into place in the box are permanently molded into the back of the dress  looks bad from the backin all definitely not one of the better barbies in the pink label line|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this isnt a bad figure of dengar  its actually pretty good for  or even  the shoulders have ball joints and the sculpt is definitely a step up from the mids version of dengar but last year hasbro released the vintage collection dengar which is the definitive version it has lots more articulation more detailed gear and paint job etc sad to say it makes this figure absolutely irrelevant except for historical purposes if youre a fan of star wars figures do yourself a favor and check out the vintage collection dengar|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|of course hasbro came out with dark empire figures in the late s if youre a fan of the comics those were great figures and definitely worth picking up in some ways i think the color schemes on those figures were more faithful to the rich yet dark colors of the comics yet its nice to see hasbro issue more dark empire figures with different interpretations of the characters these are totally new figures these two figures sure beat their s counterparts when it comes to their clothes lukes flowing robes capture a sense of power and majesty lukes face looks more mature and pained than most luke figures which is exactly as it should be the emperor has fabric robes that flow nicely also he has lightning that fits well on his hand this emperor is pale to the point of being white with the idea being that he just transferred to one of his new clones overall this isnt a substitute for the previous figures but its sure nice to get them if you have fond memories of reading the comics|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|in terms of detail hasbro went all out with the ig lancer droid its a beautiful looking figure the amount of wiring and detail is amazing unfortunately two things bring this down a star first the legs are made of rubbery plastic and bend easily its not horrible but i can imagine kids playing with this figure will destroy it quickly second he doesnt hold the lance very easily it looks like its supposed to attach to his arm but it doesnt fit anywhere overall its worth getting for fans of the tartakovsky clone wars but not recommended for play|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|swarms are tricky things in dd the reaper bones collection is swarming ahem with miniatures of this type  figures that are meant to represent swarms in theory theres a large need for miniatures representing swarms  in practice its a little more complicatedwerner klockes sculpt is old  its been around for awhile ever since vampires and druids had the ability to summon creatures before there were standardized swarm rules  dd  consolidated swarms into a very specific dimension of ten feet square  by those standards this bat swarm isnt very largethe bats themselves are something of a blurry mess  theyre mostly wings jumbled up on each other such that it becomes difficult to paint them different colors i tried anyway with a variety of brown colors but it really didnt workthe swarm is anchored by a tombstone reinforcing that these bats were likely summoned by an undead being  im not fond of pigeonholing a figure like this  it implies theyre only ever summoned outside when its more likely the opposite but still there arent a lot of bat miniatures so this is what we get the other choice is also from reaper but not in the bones set sculpted by bob olley and it features a much more distinctive bat sculpt for approximately the same price|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|as soon as i saw pictures of the lost predator by hot toys i had to get it as great as the hot toys predator figures look you have to admit a lot of them look similar to one another aside from the original predator p elder and wolf the others dont have much that make them stand out the lost predators nice green colors sure make him stand out as well as not having a lot of the weapons that many others do this was also my first predator purchase and it was a heck of an introduction to the line i was impressed by the detail they put into this figure though i guess thats to be expected at this price pointlost predator comes with quite a few accessories you can take out his mandibles and swap them with another set so they can be open or closed then theres his helmet ceremonial spear fully expandable battle spear a skull throwing disc several hands and then theres all the armor everything looks great and has the same amount of detail that the predator himself has lost predators paint is fantastic and i love the rubber dreads theyre not like the old predator figures where they had wires in each one these are all rubber and hang naturallywhat keeps him from getting  stars a bunch of little problems mine had a piece of the face just above the mandible that was bent up and despite trying to fix it with hot water it stayed up and looked weird no matter what due to an obvious gap the battle spear that can be expanded also constantly fell apart its made up of separate pieces and each one needs to be twisted on each ones end in order to stay complete and it tends to loosen over time even if you dont mess with it i should also mention that you should be careful with the tips on the spear because its surprisingly sharp what really got me though was the trouble it took to get that belt armor piece on it literally took hours of trying because its such a tight fit once you get that thing on dont take it off unless you like a challenge that hurts your fingers the net body suit wasnt too hard to get on but youll want to be careful of it getting caught on joints where its at risk of being rippedthe other big problem is that with all the armor on you just plain cant pose this figure you might simply suggest to pose it without the armor but doesnt that seem kinda lame to get a figure with all of this and not use any of it aside from the basic standing pose you see in stock picture i rarely see anyone else use another pose because you cant thanks to the shoulder and arm armor chances are that you wont be needing the stand he comes with in order to keep him standing up since theres little chance youll get him in a dymanic poseif those problems dont bother you then you should be happy with this figure it doesnt have the wrist blade or shoulder cannon like so many other predators do the green color is unique and he just plain looks good on the shelf|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this was honestly a great idea for a doll but perhaps not the best realization  the accuracy of the tattoos is quite good down to goldies fingers being very long and slighly skewed at her waist  it feels like it was designed from a real woman  but the hair is quite stiff oddly cut and perhaps a bit to difficult to make a doll look like the actual model  her face also feels very barbie and makes goldie look vapid rather than impish  the doll especially suffers when you remove her from the box  the back of the hair is flattened from the box and since it was so stiff it looks odd when the doll is displayed  the doll really loses a lot of charm when removed from the boxanother detractor is that she is not posable  her legs and arms are quite stiff  i think i would have liked this a lot more if i could have put her in some fun period poses  rather than having to rely on the same one all the timein all i do regret a bit that i purchased the doll  the likeness isnt very close she isnt posable and her hair is a true mess|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|because my daughter of seven and a half years is a lps fanatic i decided to check out this game the game is suggested for the ages of nine and up so i figured that if she was a little young for it that i could put it away for the future it seemed monoployish and we have played the powerpuff girls version of that game so if a kid can play monopoly they can play this game you will need three aa batteries before playing for the first time allow fifteen minutes to read the directions theyre pretty intense play time for us was about thirty minutes give or take a few we did bend the rules a little here and there as we were both just learning the ropes of this game just like the prior reviewers have said this game folds up neatly with all the pieces tucked inside so storage is a cinch it even has a handle for easy transport and velcro to keep the game snugly closed the game folds open to reveal a flat board with a raised border that acts as the second floor of the mall along the border of the board and along the raised border are small colored areas mall shops in which your shopper and pet have to go to to procure items a small electronic atmbuying checkpointannouncement system is placed in the middle of the board supporting a narrow cardboard bridge that shoppers can travel over to get to the other side of the mall this electronic talking hub is the directorfate of the goingson at the mall so it can sometimes lead you to a store with a great sale or somewhere way off of your intended path kids can choose between lots of stylish girls as their shopper and there are even two dudes so boys can play as well you also choose from one of four pets cat dog monkey or bird the pets fit on the base along with your character you get some dough a shopping list and a bank card the object of the game is to purchase six items off of your list before anyone else then get to the location that hub announces in order to win you check in your pet with hub and she will tell you at which stores to place the clearance and sale signs which are the places you aim to shop as we all know throughout the game hub will change the location of these signs to keep you on your toes a player then activates hub once again and hub will tell a certain player cat dog etc how many spaces to moveyou will know that it is your turn because of corresponding animal noises that hub will produce at times hub can be grating but we persevere hub may also tell you to go to the food court to pig out with your clique or to the personal trainer to work off what you just stuffed down your gullet if you miss your announcement due to shock i have to go where just press the  mark sign on hub and she will repeat if you decide to buy an item in a store you have to put your bank card in the buying slot and you can either buy an item get a suprise clearance deal or be told that the store is out of stock of your item we never got the clearance deal ha my kid went crazy at the atm and got less and less money from it as a result double ha you can cancel transactions but we never did to get to the upstairs of the mall you have to be magically transported via the hub fate use the hubs stairs or use elevators that are at either end of the board sans muzak your shopper can acquire treat tokens that can add spaces to your projected path thus when all hope fails there is a ray of light to get you to glitter pet after all if you set off the security alarm you lose a turn but my personal fav was being condemned to the litter box hey i was just reapplying my gloss i swear towards the last minutes of the the game hub pooped out for no apparent reason when we tried to make a purchase thus it was impossible for my kid to get her final destination in order to win we just improvised and my daughter won due to getting her six items first hub was easily revived and in working order when i swiped my bank card again it is totally possible that i missed something vital in the inner workings of her i mean hub another small irritation was the little plastic check marks that enabled a player to keep track of what items they had bought you had to place the little check marks that have no connecting support on your cardboard list and i can forsee disaster with this situation as a crazed dog nonplayinthegame child or dazed adult can just kick your list over enabling the check marks to fly free a table might be better for game play curiously the shopping list that players receive is rectangular with two open areas i cannot fathom why maybe in order to wear your list as mock glasses in a moment of im losing so why not go crazy desperation all in all fun game that my kid could understand and we did not have to crack our gum in a bored fashionnote on  please see comments for proper use of plastic check marks per margoti had it all wrong|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these are the  versions of the jawa figures theyre not bad but there are much better ones out there now hasbro basically put a joint right at their waistlines so they could sit however this makes the figures look pretty silly plus since when do jawas need to sit|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|warning this is not the darth vader you should get for your year old son rather this is the darth vader you should get for yourself this vader is eerily realistic and incredibly detailed for a  inch figure the cloth cape and leg coverings flow very nicely moreover this is the first time the helmet comes off in three pieces the top part comes off first and separates from the face mask you can then pull the head off to take the breathing device off not sure why youd want to do that but its actually cool to try the head is also a very well done likeness of sebastian shawhowever as i indicated above this is not a toy for kids in fact it seems hasbro didnt bother trying to make it durable first the helmet doesnt clip on and will fall off if you move him much more upsetting is that vaders right hand isnt closed enough to grasp the lightsaber its actually pretty easy to have him hold it with both hands left on the bottom right on top but it would have been nice to have had more options for posing also you might want to glue down the silver neck chain because it doesnt stay downoverall this is a great figure  for collectors not kids|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this barbie is definitely best left in the display case  she is quite lovely but when removed from the box she doesnt have half the attraction or sparkle  the dress just seems tacky outside the box and her hair and clothing doesnt seem to have the quality promised for the pricevery beautiful in box  best left that way  i recommend this more for collectors who display their collections in box or in a display cabinet rather than people who buy this for older girls  theres not a lot to for those to love who arent fanatic collectors|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|snow white is from tonner dolls  so you know her dress and sculpt will be highest quality  she comes in her signature outfit made of thick rich yellow satin married to crushed velvet on the top  her sleeves are tabbed and not just painted on stripes  and she has a thick cotton lacetrimmed muslin underskirt to provide volume under the skirt  her shoes are a yellow satin fabric that matches the dress  and she has a cape that snaps on around the large white collar of the dresssnow white is highly articulated and can be posed in my ways as a result  this means you can change up her display or pair her with the evil queen and reenact scenes from the movie|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|in addition to the harley quinn we purchased the poison ivy deluxe  like harley quinn shes just a big different than the comicanimated seriesivy has a full head of red ringlets that are quite striking i especially like how the leaves are woven into the hair and stay put as if they belong there appropriate for ivy the hair doesnt mess and she displays beautifully her skintones throughout her body are green and the costume is the right mix of quality and materialsthe things i nitpick about the doll is that her gloves never stay on correctly and the boots and gloves are perhaps a bit too shiney  they look a bit cheap compared to the dress and hairas with the harley deluxe ivy is fully articulated  she is a large doll  nearly twice as big as a barbie doll and much wider  as such she makes a striking display and feels more like a figure than a dollthe face sculpt is quite lovely but she definitely tends more towards the uma thurman ivy rather than the animated series or comics which is a shamein all a beautiful doll and a very striking display  the series also features a joker that feels very much pulled from the comics  and he doesnt blend as well with ivy and harley as a result hes a bit too cartoony compared to their realityinspired features  that said i am very happy with my purchase and can easily recommend this to batman collectors|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is cute and interesting  ive never seen another toy like it  my kids have it and love it  it has blocks with faces that you can make do different things  you can put them on a platform where they move up and down when you spin the thing on the front of it  you can also send them down a slide or make them drop by pulling a lever  i really liked this for small children  the blocks all store in it which makes it easier to keep track of them when you arent using it|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters been getting more into building things and pretending lately and when i saw kailans buildable bedroom for an incredibly low price on clearance it was an obvious buy for parents who are worried about their kids eating the smaller lego pieces or just plain losing them because of their size this is a good option and of course if they like kailan too its even betterwhat you see on the box is exactly what youre getting there arent any extra pieces included which is kind of a downer but because you can put the bedroom together in different ways its sure to extend the toys life a bit you get pieces to make the actual room part of the roof and a little outdoor area with a fencegate and of course you get tolee kailan and hoho these characters are a good size and look great for being just kids toys they have a hole in their feet so they can fit onto the other pieces and you can move their heads as well their heads are on tight so theres very little chance of them popping off and being a choking hazardthere arent any stickers to put on the bedroom walls or anything theyre already on their respective pieces basically you just get the blocks and figures everythings colorful and cute and my daughter loved putting things together with me and making super flowers flowers stacked on top of eachother to make one big one if you have the other kailan building sets this is an excellent additiongood construction learning potential great quality on the figures and its legos for kids this would be a great present for any fan of kailan now why cant the backyardigans or wubbzy get toys like this|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is cute and my kids love it  i like it because they can play together  one can play the piano keys while one hits the xylophone keys  mine often make a band and play songs for me  it is kind of heavy and very badly out of tune but its meant to be a toy and not a real musical instrument so i dont mind this  i liked it over all|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i ordered this set of max and alexander along with carol and while i wasnt as disappointed with them as i was carol i still dont feel like i got my moneys worth and this is coming from a guy who used to collect hot toys  scale figuresfirst the good alexander looks about  like he does in the movie unfortunately he isnt inscale with max or carol or the other wild things for that matter at all its just weird looking at him next to carol and seeing hes not a whole lot smaller like he should have been remember that being a key part of his character in the movie the paint on him is good though and like carol his eyes are incredible alexander has no articulation just like the others and feels just as light as carol again this feels like a cheap pvc figure or a piggy bank while he is durable you cant help but feel like you could permanently cave in his head if you stepped on it even a little bit on accident max isnt anything special the overall sculpt is good but it doesnt look like max records in the face he features a removable crown and scepter which is a complete pain to get in his right hand you have to remove the top part of it and slide the pole in his hand then put the top back on and even then you have to force it in be careful with thati cant see children getting much out of these figures as theyre more of adult collectibles being made by medicom and a part of their vcd line its too bad they didnt put as much effort into these as they do their star wars marvel and alien linesi really dont like this line of figures and wont be buying the others medicoms known for having overpriced toys that could be made much better and this is another example of that and you know what ive been a huge fan of wtwta since i was little and saw the movie just  days before my figures arrived i was in such a big wtwta fanboy mode after that and once these arrived they pretty much killed it for me unless youre completely obsessed with the wild things and need any and everything wild thingrelated i recommend you spend your money elsewhere|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive been waiting for these figures for months since they were first announced earlier this year and once pictures of them surfaced this summer i was  on them upon ordering the maxalexander set and carol here i can safely say that i have no desire to pick up the rest of these figures my mcfarlane set is more than enoughfor those who dont know medicoms vcd line is usually pretty good they cover marvel star wars and a few other licenses and usually do the vcds in a stylish look plus include a little articulation usually the arms these for wtwta have nothing they dont even feel like they should cost as much as they do in fact they come off as more of a kind of piggy bank minus the slot carol is very light and just plain feels cheap medicom did good on the sculpt but trust me when i say that he looks much different in the face inperson than he does in stock pictures the eyes and mouth are hideous and almost killed my day with how poorly done they are at least hes a good size about  inches tall and his tail isnt sculpted to the body so you can take it on and off as you please when it comes down to it though there just isnt much i can say as far as the positives of this figure goif youre considering picking these figures up youre better off waiting to see them in a store and hold them in your hand before just going and ordering a couple let alone the whole set i can see myself selling these within the next year while holding onto my mcfarlane figures at least those didnt disappoint me in any way|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this vehicle is a significant step up from the micro machines ig released during the late s the paint application is very detailed its a fairly large ship at  inches long my only complaint is that there is a copyright engraving on the top bulkhead usually the copyright is hidden on the bottom of these ships fortunately its on the black part of the ship so its pretty tough to see its frustrating but as long as you dont shine a light directly on top of the ship it looks just about perfect|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|first  check the description carefully this doll does not come with the cat  the image in the amazon description is for a different version of this dollwe have both this version and the version with the cat and the doll is the same in both  the cat is a hollow soft vinyl and not as detailed or nice as some of the barbie pets  the quality feels like what youd get as a prize out of a c gumball machinethe dolls dress is especially cheap  much more so than most barbie dolls  the velvet is stiff and feels more like flocked paper than actual fabric i dont think it is fabric  its the material you see as bows on c christmas decorations  one of our dolls was stitched so poorly that the back seems didnt match up and theres a gap in the velcro as a result  clearly quality control wasnt as important with this doll because the dress has other mismatched bunched or poorlyquickly constructed areasthe dolls sculpting and hair also feel very cheap  i would have thought this was a cheap knock off import from china rather than an actual barbie doll  the hair is light and not very pretty the vinyl of the face is rather thin the doll doesnt look like the character in the movie and the top of the dress is frayingi have a  year old and she can tell the difference in quality  despite the love of the video she doesnt have much interest in playing with this  she instead pulls out the  christmas barbie and plays with that instead  its unfortunate this came out so poor|ham

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|my son got the imaginext dragon world fortress for christmas because his aunt and uncle are awesome  i didnt realize my wife had it on my sons wish list until it showed up under the christmas tree and boy what a giftwhere to start  the castle is one big awesome sculpt  the amount of thought that went into the castle is astonishing  there is a dragon motif incorporated into everything from the bedspread on the bed to the secret stairs  centaurs are sculpted into the columns vampire bats adorn the outer walls and if you look closely at the picture you can see that the green dragon head matches the roughhewn stone of the lower section to form a complete dragon as a miniature painter myself its so pretty i want to paint itcounting the roof and the dungeon this play set has five levels starting with the base the castle is configurable two ways  one way opens a secret door into the dungeon while the other provides a helpful entrance with steps into the ground floor  which is actually an ingenious lure because it completes the winding funnel that is a rolling boulder trap  swiveling out the secret door has the added benefit of giving the castle a sturdier basefoolish mortals who manage to make it past the boulder trap face off against the portcullis  its here that there are footholds for the two knights  simply put the knights feet into the footholds and turn to active the mechanism  it sounds good in practice but is harder for my nearly threeyearold boy  he asks me to do it  turning the footholds causes the portcullis to raise or lower along with an accompanying kachunk thunder and lightning and even an owl hooting  the portcullis mechanism itself is a series of wheels and gears along with a little rope that winds through it  you dont find this level of detail on professional gaming miniature sculptsas if getting crushed by a boulder or speared by a portcullis wasnt bad enough theres an animated dragon head that can be manipulated from the other side of the castle  the head swings up and down and side to side  when slamming it down over the poor fool standing in the handholds the mouth opens and closes  after scooping up the hapless victim it can then swing out and drop him into the moat  this doesnt always work  the mouth on the dragon must be slammed down pretty hard to guarantee it eats somebody but the effect is glorious to behold when it worksalso in the base of the castle is another foothold mechanism to reveal a series of red secret steps  turning the foothold opens and closes these spiraling steps to the dungeonthe next level features wooden steps complete with metal rivets  it has a beautifully sculpted dragon chandelier that hangs by a real string  my guess is you drop it on any invading knight who happens to have made it this far but in practice it doesnt really do much but dangle  theres also an accompanying bed that probably goes here to give you an idea of the detail of this toy flipping the bed over reveals a broadsword fastened to the bottom its part of the sculpt not a separate sword  fisher price thought of everythingthe next level features the beginning of the boulder trap  a trap door is triggered by a little button on the side  there are two sound animations to accompany the boulder rolling its way to crush the enemy  one sounds like fine china being smashed while the other has a cat shrieking in dismay  my son could press this button all day long if we let him speaking of the boulders they get quite a bit of momentum as they roll down the trap but arent so heavy that theyll do any toy real harmat the top of the castle is the piece de resistance the concealed dragon face  by turning the footholds at the top of the castle a snout teeth and eyes appear  the bristling claws on either tower extend but not much to the accompanying roar of a dragon its theoretically possible to position a knight in the mouth of this dragon which would cause him to fall out of it as soon as it was activated with the footholds but in practice this doesnt work  the mouth is too flimsy to hold anybody  its a cool effect but might be frightening for younger children  my son didnt seem to mind italso atop the castle are a place for dragonshaped flags and a cannon  if theres a concern for little kids playing with this toy its this cannon which fires a crossbowshaped bolt  it doesnt shoot it very far but its extremely sensitive so its easy to fire the thing by accident like in your eye for example  we wont let my son play with it until hes olderthe knights have fully posable arms and legs  the red knight looks surprised the gray knight wears a fierce frown  their arms rotate in the sockets as well as the wrists and each can hold their own colorcoded shield and sword  the armor is an uppertorso affair covering most of the head and locking it into place  it can be a bit of a challenge to get the suits of armor on knights if their heads are turned as a resulti could go on and on  the short of it is that this set is awesome my son loves it too although he wont really be able to fully enjoy the entire set until he gets older  thats okay though the toy can grow along with him  in the mean time we keep the dragon busy eating astronauts from another play set and lets face it they deserve itanyone attempting to invade the castle is asking to be crushed skewered chomped bludgeoned terrified or speared|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my  year old loved this  its very kid friendly and has large controls to make the dragon movement  it might be too hard for a  year old to make the dragon lunge but i think thats something theyd enjoy with mom or dad anyway  my  year old would make the dragon attack all the time and used it quite a bit for imagine playthe dragon is very durable and sturdy but doesnt have any bad pokey parts for little hands the legs are also movable  in all highly recommended for little ones who like dragons|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter got scout for christmas a few months ago and since then this has easily become her favorite toy the one that shell take with her when she goes over to someones house goes on a long trip or wants something to cuddle when shes sleepy and in the car or stroller this really is a cute little toy and seeing all the things it can say is cool because this is an educational toyif you havent seen it in stores scout is a cuddly plush dog who talks and sings songs as well as plays music you connect him to your computer using a usb cord and you can get even more out of him including the ability to say your childs name of course how well he can say their name depends on how normal it is which ill get to in a minute you can adjust the volume with buttons on scouts collar and the battery life is surprisingly good i think he went a month and a half before needing new batteries scout sings a bunch of cool happy songs and im not ashamed to say that i know them all by heart now when connected to your computer you can imput a few things like what your childs favorite color food animal and more are and scout will use those words in one of his songs also you can download and print out a lot of cool coloring pages its like this guys just full of surprisesi dont have any complaints about this toy at all but regarding scout learning names you have to be a bit forgiving my daughters name is kairi pronounced kheyeree and scout says it kayeyeree its not a hard name for people to say and i really didnt expect scout to say it right either but think about how simple her name is and then wonder if your childs name is more difficult how hes gonna say it all the other words weve programmed hes said alright but its still worth mentioning in case youre that concerned about pronunciationthe only thing to take care with regarding scout is cleaning him use a damp cloth to wipe any marks on him and be careful taht you dont use too much water because it could still get inside and mess with his battery box or the wires be careful around his paws and collar where the buttons are located also some people complain about the usb cable being too short but it wasnt a problem for me it all depends on your computers set up and where you plug it in but you just need enough room for scout to sit while connected to the computer not a big dealfor the standard retail price scouts an amazing deal a lot of toys like this cost twice as much so this is a great purchase for your child that doesnt hurt the wallet hes cute fun and even provides his own kind of coloring book as long as you have a printer this is a great toy and im glad to see my daughter care so much for him|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|if you have the international playthings rocket you known that a threeeyed alien made his debut in the iplaythings universe  unfortunately said alien could only cower under a rock  he was too big to pilot any of the astronauts vehicles  that problem is finally corrected with the iplay flying saucerthis has to be the first flying saucer thats made for young children  being a scifi fan i scooped it up along with all the other iplay scifi sets for my son for christmaslike the rocket this set comes with its own aliens one orange one blue theyre the exact same sculpt but considerably more civilized as they have their own rocket ship  no hiding in rockets for these guysunlike the rocket the flying saucer is kidsized  my son can easily carry it around by the helpful handle thats connected to the saucer which incidentally looks like a giant death ray hee hee  lights circle the ship and blink to a series of sounds whenever the rocket is jostled  pressing the purple button on the green handle also cycles through a series of sounds  each of these sounds mimics the saucer landing taking off or flying through space  they are all unique and distinct from the rocket which is appreciated  this feels like a s style ufothe alien pilots have a dashboard they can interact with  it includes three kidsized buttons  two are blips and beeps but they are distinct from the random sounds you get when pressing the button on the handle  the third my favorite is what can only be described as alien language  these three buttons unlike the handle button play the same sounds each time so you know what sound you get  when youre roleplaying the first encounter between aliens and astronauts this is very important  the aliens can speak on cueanother nifty feature i didnt discover until later is that theres a sliding plastic cover to the cockpit  it recesses into the ufos wall giving the aliens inside the saucer an air of mystery  my son hates this feature for some reason and always pushes the lens back into the ship but i think its neatthe flying saucer definitely has more multimedia than the rocket but i wish it wouldnt have to remind me all the time  the flying saucer goes off at random moments whirring to let us know its still there  it can be a bit disconcerting to hear an alien spaceship sound coming from your childs room in the middle of the night sometimes i find the astronauts from the other playsets inside the ufo and wonder if the saucers been out abducing other toysof the three toys rocket one space base two and the flying saucer this is the best of the bunch if you plan to raise a little scifan yourself this is a great place to start|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|definitely produced naturally which is a good thing we have three of these streamers two regular sized one mini in our joint one of the decorative ballsstreamer retainer did come off easily i believe that this is due to the natural glue that is used to keep the ball and streamer in place as opposed to chemicalladen glue that can attach and hold burly men and their hardhats to girders the ball is easy enough to put back in place either use wood glue like a prior reviewer suggested or you can even just twistpush it ontweak it until you feel it is secure thats my method dont obsess just let your hands guide you i do want to clarify that it is not that these streamers get tangled easily they just get knots that magically appear here or there on the streamer after maybe like three play sessions whoa hold on a minutei just asked my daughter what she thought about the knot situation and she confessed that she knots the streamer on purpose and that some knots are natural so i will have to update this review after experimentation anyway the knots are easily removed and do not affect the performance of the streamer i have seen a wide range of prices on this toy so do your homework first i sometimes use this ribbon myself and i swear that i could make it to the olympic games with this baby|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|satheras elf warlock by bobby jackson is the first elf in the reaper bones line and as such provokes an interesting question is an elf and elf if you cant see his earsjudging by the other sculpts in the bones line reapers elves are primarily defined by their long limbs thin frame height and yes pointed ears  since you cant see satheras ears because theyre hidden beneath his hood satheras elf status is determined by his other features  which means that really theres no reason this figure cant be a tall humansatheras status as warlock is appropriate  theres something sinister about his cloaked appearance the way his face is partially hidden in his hood and how he clutches his gemtipped staff  he also wields a scroll in one hand  you dont see this very often in sculpts which gives painters the option to put whatever they like on it i prefer the yellow sign but that tends to limit the usefulness of the sculpt in games  i went with reds and yellows in traditional cultist fashionthe whiff of the infernal follows this sculpt which makes satheras very useful as a villain  also satheras name just sounds villainous when you say it out loud satherasthere may be a world where satheras hopes to be an agent of peace bringing love and joy to orcs everywherebut it seems more likely satheras will be summoning unspeakable horrors instead  a versatile sculpt that could be villain or antihero with the right paint job|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i remember wanting a chain chomp when i was younger id played the mario games in the late s and early s but it wasnt until i played super mario rpg when i was in th grade that i really thought these things were cool bowser used a chain chomp as a weapon swinging it around his head and then hurling it at the enemy if you pressed a button just before it connected with the enemy the chomp would bite them for some reason that seemed like one of the greatest attacks ever in a game to me and i tried making my own chain chomp but was unsuccessful well  years later my daughter got me one as a present and while unexpected its something i was secretly excited for now i can relive those glory days of the lateskindathe chain chomp is surprisingly cuddly for being a killer ball with teeth the body feels like fleece the outline around the pupils and whites of the eyes are sewn and the rest is kind of fuzzy the mouth is held open with cardboard under the fabric and the teeth seem to be made of vinyl it has a short chain attached at the back and its pretty durable for being part of a stuffed toy the links dont bend when you squeeze them or anything so it could actually be aluminum or another lighter metal and not plastic of course ive spun the chain chomp around and let him go with the wind a few times since i got him and he flies pretty well you can attach another chain to the one thats already on him or just take off the existing one and replace it if you likeof the three colors available im partial to the red but theyre all cool and this blue ones fun to have around it looks great hanging from a wall or just staring down people from a shelf ready to attack the only reason im giving it  stars is because the teeth can get damaged easily since theyre so thin but for the price this is a good deal and one of the better mario bros plushes out there now if only it had a voice chip that made the chomping sound from mario rpg|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the lego games have been doing pretty well since lego star wars debuted a few years ago take a wildly popular franchise turn it into legoform and you have a simple charming fun game for all ages lego star wars was huge when it came out and got great reviews for the most part i enjoyed both of the games in that series and had a blast playing with a friend thanks to the easy dropindropout coop then lego indiana jones came along andwell the less said the better lego batman did ok but was pretty forgettable ask anyone who bought it if theyve played it at all in the last year so now its harry potters turn does the boy wizard make magic for the lego series and turn it back in the right direction yes and no harry potter is definitely suited for similar play style to lego star wars what with magic being the force here and blasters being replaced by wands but the games still glitchy as all heck even after the software update installed when you go online either way this is a fun game for kids and their parents to enjoy together but therell be frustration here and therechances are that if youre on this page youre a fan of the harry potter books or movies so its kinda pointless to go over the story especially since this game covers  years worth of material but if you never played a lego game before it takes the movie its based on simplifies it into a pretty cute but not embarrassingly cute plot with lots of tongueincheek comedy while having more emphasis on gameplay than story the story progresses through cutscenes usually before and after levels and the game actually lets you play for long periods of time something a lot of games for mature people are lacking seriously how sick are you of playing through an intense portion of an action or shooter only to have the flow interrupted by a cutscene that wont happen here here youll play as harry and his friends with many characters to choose from in the harry potter universe if you have a favorite character who had a few lines of dialogue in the movies theres a good chance youll get to play as them here a second person can join in just by pressing start on a second controller and they can leave at any time allowing the ai to take over again like the previous lego games this is an actionplatformer for the most part and youll blast enemies with spells build devices with legos and collect tons of lego pieces after blowing things apart its pretty good funwhile lego harry potter is easily accessible to people with any level of gaming experience the bugs will ruin it for some as you mightve read in other reviews some people have lost things they bought in the games store when purchasing items as player  and some entire files have been mysteriously erased levels have parts where you may get stuck in a wall or your character will somehow get stuck in the floor while running its frustrating and i dont get how this series has been plagued with these problems for so long without being fixed example in the very first level of the game i did dove towards some lego pieces early on and my guys head got stuck in the wall their body gyrated for a few seconds before they started to lose hearts then he died when they came back a second later everything was fine but stillwhy was something so stupid overlooked reminds me of some of the glitches in super mario  back in the day my other problem is more of a nitpick but it bugged me enough to take off a star this whole game seems too busy there are lots of objects and characters to interact with in levels what with a lot of the action taking place at hogwarts and it takes a few seconds to select the objectperson you want to use magic on or blast with your wand before you actually get to do it i hate to keep going back to lego star wars but it seemed like the two games in that series had more polish and there was more space to get things done in here everything felt very clutteredthe graphics arent going to be impressing anyone as theyre very simple and this game couldve been done on the systems from the last console generation but it still looks good and the games simple lego design gets the job done there wasnt much slowdown when i played but there were some other visual problems like the levels looking a bit wavy when id move the camera its no big deal though and shouldnt bug anyone unless theyre looking for it the music is sure to be familiar to fans of the movies but dont go expecting much in the vocal departmentlego harry potter is a fun game but it lacks polish i almost want to say that they rushed the release to go along with the last movies but this came out at the end of june and the movie just came out  days ago maybe the next lego harry potter will get more attention to detail and be less buggy but as it is i highly recommend this over indiana jones and batman but if you havent played a lego game before id recommend star wars first|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i remember getting these figures for christmas before even playing the game they were advertised in a game magazine and cost quite a bit when i got them everything looked cool but frankly thats about the extent of what these figures can do look coolcloud here is probably the only one who had some work put into him his arms are articulated at the shoulder and elbow and he can turn his head around the rest of him is immobile and like most of the others in this set he may as well have been a pvc figure he comes with the signature buster sword and the hard edge as well as an odd looking stand that you snap one of his feet intothat thing is none of these figures are made very well clouds head and arms pop out of the sockets effortlessly the buster sword is too heavy to be kept in a pose without falling down and his bangs are barely glued in place so theyll probably be the first thing to go add in some sloppy paint work and youve got a mess of a figure this is a pretty small figure too especially if you compare it to the newer play arts ones which are better in every waysomething cool though is that these were some of the first figures to my knowledge that came in easily resealable packaging the plastic bubble folds around the sides of the cardboard backer and you can put the figure back in for semimoc display if you wantthe only people who should shell out the stupidly high amount of money these go for now are those who absolutely have to have everything ffrelated orno thats about it i ended up selling my figures to someone when i was in highschool for less than  of what they cost when they came out and didnt feel like it was a bad deal at all these figures are terrible and if you have to have one of cloud go for any of the play arts ones|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i always regretted not having found these when they first came out in the late s i finally tracked them down for a reasonable price i like both ships the space jockey ship is actually pretty detailed for a toy of this size it looks a bit too shiny for the ship but of course it was dark in the movie i always saw the ship as more reddish than bluish the armored personnel carrrier looks good as well the two guns swivel the apc is also close to scale size with the action fleet drop ship the two figures are decent about the size of action fleet figures so if you have those aliens action fleet ships these figures are a nice addition but if you dont have the action fleet ships and those were rare then the figures are just kind of extra id have preferred another ship overall if you can track this down its a nice treat for aliens fans|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive been meaning to buy some of the minimates figures for a long time now but unfortunately most of the ones i wanted to get are long gone my daughters into ghostbusters at the moment and when she saw these lego ghostbusters she had to have them after checking these things out when she wasnt looking you know what these are pretty cool toys even being as little as they are any kid or adult collector is sure to get a kick out of thesein this set you get the slimed version of peter and the clear version of slimer peter has a disgusted expression on his face and it looks great he has green slime all over his jumpsuit and comes with his proton pack which has the gun portion that he can hold in one hand he has pretty good articulation too at the shoulders elbows wrists head and legs he even has little elbow pads that you have to move out of the way so you can bend his arms i was surprised with how well they painted him right down to the ghostbusters patch on his sleeve i know with these minimates figures you can mix and match parts with other minimates for example you can take off peters hair and replace it with say winstons the only things to watch out for with him are the cord on the proton pack connecting to the gun part since its very thin plastic and could snap easily and making sure that his limbs are all snapped in place so you dont lose anything finally he comes with the laser stream for his gun so he can catch slimer i actually couldnt get mine to stay on the gun but its therethe clear slimer looks great and im glad they made a new sculpt for him instead of just slapping the face on a regular minimates body theres the outer shell for slimer which makes up his body and it slides onto a minimates body with the arms and head where the shell snaps onto from the inside he also comes on a clear plastic stand so it makes him look like hes floating around the body also has some food painted on it making it looks like how he did in the movie when he took in plate after plate of goodies no complaints here at all slimer looks fantastic and this is my favorite version of him from the minimates series he also has articulated arms like peter but thats it for obvious reasonsoverall these are really cool toys and i cant wait to buy my daughter and myself more you can get a lot of good poses out of the basic minimates body and the different facial expressions in this ghostbusters line makes for lots of display possibilities the price is usually good too provided you get these when they come out at retail rather than paying inflated prices hint hint highly recommend these guys and now i have to track down those man with no name ones|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|castle panic is a collaborative game that features a very simple concept warriors are trapped in a tower and goblinoids of all varieties are trying to eat them  thats it despite its simple and grim concept castle panic is a highly entertaining collaborative game for familiesthe board consists of six segmented concentric circles divided into two segments of three colors red green blue radiating from the center  in order from the center towers walls then the swordsman knight and archer circles and finally the forest circle  the tower and walls act as hit points of sorts and the circles are striking range archerlong knightmedium swordsmanshort  monsters move one circle towards the center each round and a variety of other monster tokens can move them between segments or closer to the tower boss monsters of various types also influence the number of monsters that appear and how they movethe game consists of two components cards and monster tokens  the cards consist of each type of warrior as well as special features like a barbarian who can take monsters out anywhere on the board players refresh their hand each round and can use as many cards as they like  although its possible to compete between players with a monster trophy system highest number of monsters slain wins the games cooperative element really comes into play during the trading phase when players can share cards between them  the colorcoding makes it an easy game to understand for children which is why it works so well as a family collaborationthe monster tokens have some challenges however  the monster tokens are triangles with a monsters stats on one side and a leering face on the other each triangle points inward toward the circle with the monsters hit points goblins have  orcs have  and trolls have   when the monster is hit by a warrior the triangle is changed to point the lower number of hit points towards the center so a troll that gets hit for  point is turned so that the number  points toward the centerthe problem is that the tokens also have effects like a plague that wipes out certain warriors a boulder that smashes through everything in its path and other monsterspecific effects  the monster tokens are shuffled which is relatively impossible given the way theyre designed  these tokens would have been better served as cards that would be easier to shuffle and place on the boardthe other problem is what happens once the monsters get inside the castle walls  only a handful of cards can actually affect a monster within the walls which means that if enough monsters breach the outer defenses its a foregone conclusion that the monsters will win this is a simple fix however  just make it so that swordsmen can also affect monsters within the castle wallscastle panics simplicity perfect for kids  the game is easy to tweak  despite its grim subject matter its a great family game for budding geeks of all ages|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|first for those who havent been introduced for the world of kubricks theyre usually very cool and cute little figures similar to lego people theyre a little bigger than those but much more detailed kubricks tend to come in blind boxes where you get a box with a random figure inside its a fun line and theyre huge in japan and with collectors everywhere if you want to see good kubricks check out the star wars oneshowever these kubricks for where the wild things areare just plain ugly they look exactly as they do in the stock picture which isnt good at all every single one of them looks like they have downs syndrome or just took a bunch of sleeping pills douglas got it the worst when it comes to the design category and looks like a mutated chicken more than anything the paint on these guys is all wrong too im being very generous with my rating because yes you can have fun playing with these since theyre wtwta figures and just as durable as any other kubrick but theyre just so ugly i highly recommend getting a different kind of kubrick for a better first impression if you havent gotten any before because these will probably make you hate the seriestheres also a chance of getting a rare bearbrick figure and you could always sell that for a pretty penny but again i cant recommend buying these at all unless youre the hardest of hardcore wild things collectorsmedicom really screwed up with this license the vcds were overpriced and cheaply made and these kubricks arent any better stick with the mcfarlane figures if you need some wild things|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the concept for this was interesting  you can turn the dress up and hide the torso so that she turns into a frog  it should have given you the best of both worlds  both a doll and a stuffed animal for added play valuethe problem is that the frog mode has pointy hard plastic arms and body inside that make it a lumpy looking stuffed animal missing half its stuff  the girl version doesnt do anything  the skirt is soft and there are no legs to keep the shape of the dress  so she just flops over  it ends up feeling like there is only half a doll there or a really sad sack stuffed frogmy  year old cant get the head into the frog velcro area very easily so shes given up trying to transform from girl to frog  the velcro catches on tianas hair and wrecks it unfortunatelyit just sits in the closet right now because it isnt a doll it isnt a stuffed animal it doesnt transform easily and it isnt even that attractive as frog or dollthis was a disappointment|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this comicpack includes figures of two of the star wars new jedi orders most powerful warriors first the star of the set is obviously the yuuzhan vong warrior this is a big figure easily a head or two taller than most star wars figures not only that but hes got above average articulation hasbro did a superb job with the paint and sculpt of the yuuzhan vong the aliens muscles and veins bulge out reminding me of the veins on michelangelos moses i cant ever recall any figure with such exquisite anatomical detail im so glad hasbro treated the yuuzhan vong with respect and made such a good figure hasbro hasnt made many new jedi order figures and the series hasnt always received respect from fans the yuuzhan vong is such a distinctive villain so its important to get it right my only complaint is that the figures face isnt covered with blue tatoos as many yuuzhan vong are but of course there is variation amongst the yuuzhan vongthe second figure is kyle katarn hero of the dark forces video games i remember playing the first dark forces when i was younger but that katarn looked quite different sans facial hair the later dark forces games portray katarn as a bit more of a mix between a jedi and smuggler the figure captures this mix perfectly and katarn comes with both a lightsaber and blaster the blaster is particularly detailed the figure itself is pretty good although the face is a bit bland hes got a good range of articulation but surprisingly less than the yuuzhan vong which also has ankle jointsoverall both figures are done well its nice to finally get some new jedi order figures im looking forward to nom anor whos coming out later this year|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|fans of the star wars legacy comics have wanted a figure of darth krayt for years this version is pretty good but not perfect the armor is a bit dull and doesnt have a metallic sheen the spikes could be bigger however the biggest problem is that his left hand doesnt hold a lightsaber meaning krayt can only hold one saber at a timethere are two versions of sigel dare one of them has too much eye blush and looks a bit silly while the other is well painted be careful and ask sellers which one youll getoverall this set is great for fans of the legacy comics too bad its so expensive|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|neca did an incredible job with these figures the detailing is extremely realistic if you rub your finger along the body it feels like rough wrinkled skin neca also managed to get quite a bit of articulation including wrist leg elbow shoulder and two neck joints one at the base and one near the head et is around  inches tall but hes a pretty bulky figure and looks quite largethe galactic friend figure comes with a wraparound towel the towel is moulded not cloth so you can really only dress et up in it one way however it looks great on him it can be removed to get a naked version of et one warning with the towel is that at a few points some of the white paint rubbed onto the figure i was initially pretty upset but i noticed that just rubbing those spots with a wet cloth completely removed the white paint and solved the problemthis figure also comes with a neck extension so you can make the neck longer it looks great although admittedly is a bit tough to get on you have to position the ball in the ball socket straight so you can push it in my advice is to just switch to the longer neck and leave itmy only complaint is that the small reeses pieces accessory doesnt have a label its just an orange bag of candy the trademark was probably left off for legal reasons still thats a pretty small complaintthe dress up figure comes with moulded hair dress and a mink scarf just like from the scene in the movie he also comes with a small bag that you can take off the clothes and hair are not to my knowledge removable they seem glued on although in theory you could probably rip them off and still have the base figurethe thing i love most about this figure is the face rather than simply using the same head as the galactic friend figure this ets face has a very concernedpuzzled look just like in the movie the mouth looks a bit scrunched up and the upper lip starting to frown as opposed to the other et figures smile its awesome that neca took the time and effort to add that amount of detailit took  years but finally we have an et figure worth of the film well worth the price|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ibuki is a character i dont care all that much for but when i saw this figure in the store last weekend and saw that she came with a tanuki i made sure to buy her sota made a ton of pretty good street fighter figures not that long ago and covered a good portion of the cast before they stopped of all the companies that have put out street fighter figures id say that theyve done the best job converting the d sprites to action figure form most of them were wellarticulated came with some good accessories like alternate heads and extra hands and the scale of some of the bigger characters like sagat and birdie was just plain cool yep you never felt ripped off when you bought one of these guysuntil they broke unfortunately i broke ibuki within minutes of taking her out of the package if youve never owned one of these figures before be very cautious when changing hands but ill get to that lateribuki stands at about  inches tall and the sculpt on her is great she looks like she popped right out of the game the pants are super baggy the slits on the sides are just right the hair looks greatanyone whos ever played street fighter iii or iv will know who this is i was especially impressed with the articulation on her you can move the following head shoulders elbows hands the waist in two ways bend forwardback or twist around upper legs knees heels toes you wanna pose her doing a tiptoe ninja sprint go for it you want her to be doing her cool fireball blast throw thingy you can get her in that pose without any problems my figure had a few stiff joints at first but as long as youre careful moving them around they shouldnt break ibuki also comes with  extra hands  right and  left a single kunai an extra mask with a different sculpt and of course her tanuki the hands look really good especially the ones with the fingers pointed out her little clenched fists just look too tiny to me so id suggest using these to get some cooler poses out of her the kunai can be held in the other hands easily and hasnt fallen out once im not going to try getting the other mask on for reasons im about to get into but that tanuki is just so adorable that you cant help but want to put that guy anywhere in the house hes one solid piece of plastic with no articulation but is cute with that big goofy expression on his face and he has a yellow bandana around his tailso whats the problem and why wont i put on her other mask well as i said earlier ibuki broke almost immediately upon being taken out of the box to change hands and get her head off so you can switch masks you have to pull the hands or head out of the sockets sometimes you luck out and do it right other times the peg of the hand breaks off and stays in the arm and is stuck in there for good this means no putting in other hands and thats exactly whats going on with my poor ibukis right hand the only solution unless youre really good with tiny knives is to super glue the hand back on the arm but that kills the articulation for that hand you cant move it around any more and itll be stuck in one pose this may or may not be a bad thing though if you have a pose that you really like and want ibuki to stay in it then theres no issue but for people like me who like to change things now and then it bites and i wish theyd have made it so you could just screw the hands in with a few twists instead im not even going to attempt taking the head off just to put on the other mask since id like to be able to move ibukis head around and not have it stuck looking forward i cant stress it enough be very very careful when changing out the hands maybe dipping her arms in a cup of hot water before doing so to loosen up everything wouldve been a good idea well now you have that to go by from my mistakeeven with her messed up hand i really like this figure and im glad i bought it the tanuki is constantly being moved around by both my daughter and myself since we love it so much hell be next to the vinylmation figures one minute and then on the chunli fightstick the next pick up this figure if you can get it for a good price|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i think my daughter just about blew a gasket when she saw shaymin in the store a few months ago having her own shaymin made her day her week even and of course hes a cute little plush its shaymin after all jakks did a good job converting him to the plush form though hes still not as good as the official poke center onesshaymins a good size about the size of the mini plush torkoal and the colors on him really pop out at you the flower leaves are made of a thick felt that wont easily tear and the flower itself is a thin felt and some other material ive never seen before the felt layer separates from the other layer easily so be careful with that if you want shaymin to last a long time his eyes are sewn in and look good and hes also got a cute little smile toothe problem is that the top layers of grass or leaves on him dont look like they do in the stock picture every single shaymin ive seen so far has this problem they stick up and out i dont know what happened with production but chances are that youll end up with a shaymin that looks like hes trying to be some kind of shark you can see this in the product pictures ive uploaded of course your child probably wont mind because the fact that they have a shaymin should overpower any little problems but for adults that collect stuffed pokemon and want their plush to look as good as possible you might just want to skip over this shayminagain thats just a little nitpick and my daughter sure didnt care about it she plays with him constantly and takes him on adventures outside now and then if your child loves shaymin definitely get this one while you still can|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|before i start though the rating applies if you get this package for retail which is more reasonable but here youre getting  fairly popular pokemon figures in one deal shaymin wobbuffet and yanmega all  figures look great and exactly like their animated versions like i said in the reviews for other pokemon toys its a shame we didnt get figures of this quality when pokemon first hit huge in the late snone of the figures really have articulation except yanmega but thats also the one thing keeping this from being a  star product yes you can move his wings up and down but theyre likely to pop off since theyre not set in his body very well in fact mine did pop out when i moved them around its not a huge problem but they shouldve fastened these in there better otherwise yanmega looks fantastic and its about time we got a cool bug pokemon figure wobbuffet is in his infamous pose and shaymins looking cute as usual i like that shaymin isnt super tiny and they made him pretty big these figures dont really follow the right scale if that were the case regigigas figure would be massive even in this scale but since theyre all big that should give your kids even more fun and less of chance to lose them somewherethe only other gripe is standard with this line the paint used isnt that great if your child takes these toys in the bath with them the paint will fade after a few weeksso if you can get these figures at the original cost its a great deal this pack is pretty recent so you can probably still find them if you look around and come on just look at wobbuffets face how can you turn that down|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|after you throw it out into a busy highway and encourage traffic to hit itseriously this is one of the worst toys ive ever seen all of these negative reviews speak the truth this thing doesnt work like it should by now youd think the maker wouldve replaced it with a newer version that can be played but nope this unplayable mess is still being shipped to stores this is supposed to be a toy story take on the classic magnetic fishing game that you can still buy with the ts aliens replacing the fish and you pick them up using the toy machine claw instead of with a fishing pole whereas the fishing game works since each fish has a magnet in its mouth thats not the case here or maybe it is and its just plain defective in that aspect toosee when you turn the game on the purple area with the aliens rotates and some of them pop up youre supposed to catch those with the claw but the claw is set in a pretty wide open position and it rarely closes down on the aliens regardless of how close you are to them be it directly above touching the sides of the aliens head or pressed down on them  times out of  you wont catch the alien theres no button or anything on the claw stick either you just dangle it over the aliens hoping to catch one you know its pretty bad when you really do get excited when you finally catch one of these suckers especially in a toy store with tons of people around and go i finally caught onethis is just a bad product and i hope that no good children get this for christmas or for their birthdays even if they want it this is the kind of thing an abusive parent gives to their child when they want them to think theyre getting something fun but its really the toy equivalent of being told to go out back and cut a switch save yourself the money and save your kids the torment by not buying this thing|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is a nice set in that it has complete dresses and not mix and match pieces that get lost easily  the material for the dresses is on the thin side even for barbie standards but the outfits are at least not as tacky as some that mattel has put out this year  one thing i dont like is that the designs on the front never continue to the back you cant see that when they are in the box of course  the gold dress in this set for example has the belt and tie on the front  but the belt and tie stop at the side seams and the back is plainim rating this a  star because this is a classier set than many of the alternative fashion sets this year|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the outfits here are nice and have a bit of diversity  but they seem like a lot of little pieces top here skirt there boa there purse here that dont really add up to a concrete set of  looks  because there isnt much too them it makes them easy to get on and off a doll for a young girl  i just wish there was more to them since the pieces get mixed in with other clothes  younger girls seem to like to have just one dress rather than little pieces of other dresses to put together|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of the better dolls in the my career vintage repros  note that the swirl on her banks differs and some are better than others  but the clothing look of the doll and accessories make her a winner when deboxed  i have her on display and was really pleased with the purchase|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i think mattel must have stayed true to the original  but for the modern collector it may be a bit off to have a doll with big clumsy boots and gloves clumpy formless suit and giant plastic dome  the hair is stiff and not really moldable  it seems like something best left in the box  the flag looks like one of those c party cocktail toothpick decorationsin all this was my least favorite in the barbie career dolls  feels like a better concept than actual reality|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i was really glad i chose this one of the barbie basics  she has a sweet face a beautiful smile and i like that her face is more rounded and healthier looking than the other model dolls  shes more beautiful and fun girl next door than she is haute couture model  her hair is quite lovely out of the box and she looks very good from all angles when displayed  i especially like how open and friendly she feels  as if she has a personality and isnt just a random molded doll with typical pretty features|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this doll is really interesting  my  year old loves it  when you push the button on her leg a blade in the back rotates and as it does creates wings made out of lights  the lights are programmed so that the wings appear to be flapping and moving around  its something that is hard to explain in writing but very interesting when seen  of all the electronic wings barbies this was definitely the best concept  the only downside is that when the wings arent spinning there is the blade left in the back rather than wings  i would have liked it better if the blade had been encased between transparent filament wings so that she was pretty when the blade wasnt whirring and creating her lightbased fluttering wingsthe outfit she is wearing is nice as is her hair and styling  note that the legs and arms do not bend so she is a standingflying doll only  but in my opinion something original and different and well worth the price for a little girl who loves fairies|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|skinny pink space babe probably isnt the most popular character in the hasbro toy line however if youre a fan of the cantina scene leesub sirln was there so you have to get her and fortunately hasbro did a great job leesub comes loaded with articulation but hasbro managed to hide it surprisingly well given that most of the joints are showing on her bright pink skin i also really like that she comes with a glass which is great for cantina dioramasdefinitely recommended for fans of the star wars cantina|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|dengar has always been my favorite of the star wars bounty hunters while boba fetts slave i has been made dozens of times and even bossk and ig had micromachine versions of their ships but not dengar as such i was very happy to see that punishing one was included in the titanium series its a pretty good replica but sadly its not perfect the cockpit is a matte black but really should be glossy because its a window moreover something about the ship just doesnt look realistic still its great to finally have it|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ive always loved this version of kiadi mundi i love how its a whole new take on a jedi rather than the drab brown robes they always wear ive always thought he looked more at home in the force unleashed game the figure is well done although given that hes supposed to be a battle veteran he could have used a bit more dirt and weathering definitely a must for your collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i dont ever remember hrcheck kal fas being particularly creepy in the actual cantina scene yet hasbros rendition of him makes him look pretty scary for that alone i cant say the figure really captures the likeness of this guy still its a great figure very detailed a good amount of articulation and a versatile pose my only complaint is that the jacket doesnt come off  its essentially fixed to the body itd definitely be worth picking up one or two of these guys for your cantina diorama|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the palm beach series coral bathing suit and this one breeze were a very welcome addition to the more classic and traditional bfmc collection  instead of evening dresses or career dolls we get a great look and feel of palm beach florida in the sbreeze is wearing a soft flowing almost seethrough crepesilk like caftan  underneath she has light blue silk undergarements  the arabesque neckline is decorated with beads and she wears matching earrings of blue beadswhat i really love about breeze is that she is so different from nearly every other bfmc collector doll  her clothes arent form fitting or even form enhancing  instead they are light and airy and swirl around her beautifully  her hair is thick and lush but admittedly has to be occasionally tamed because there is so much of it  she wears matching blue high heelsbecause this doll is so unusual she really does stand out from the other more glam barbies  i think she is quick lovelier in person than the picture shows and was very pleased when i bought her  i immediately took her out of the box and she looks just as good on displaypalm beach breeze is from the high end collector bfmc series  she is a silkstone  made of a vinyl plastic that is similar in weight and texture to porcelain  since she is in the bfmc series her clothing and accessories are of the highest quality  most bfmc dolls also have vintage faces|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the costars of the barbie movies never seem to get much care  they arent given the characters names or likenesses not even close and the quality usually falls greatly off from the main character  honestly they feel kind of pointless theres not a lot of play value if the dolls dont look like the ones who talk to merliah in the movie and certainly their quality doesnt compare to merliahthis doll has a hard plastic hollow body that feels cheap and doesnt bend  the tail rotates on the base and the body bends forward  but the body has a bathing suit that doesnt match the tail and looks kind of dumb when the doll is sitting the arms and chest are also stiff plastic that just feels cheap  the face is very generic barbie dollthe doll is inexpensive and thats really the only redeeming feature  but for twice the price i really recommend the mattel barbie splash and style meraids  they have rubber bodies and tails that twist and bend httpwwwamazoncombarbiesplashstylemermaidangeldpbetfurefsr  ieutfstoysandgamesqidsr  since the co stars are generic and not tied into the movie anyway might as well get a mermaid that feels and looks goodin all i dont recommend getting this because of the dvd  it doesnt appear in the movie and doesnt look like the costars  its fine as a generic inexpensive fairy doll|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this is one of  destinies from the movie a mermaid tale  of the three this wasnt the head destiny and was more of a supporting character  if you are trying to decide on which destiny to buy i would recommend the pink one in the jeans over the purple and blue ones  the pink destiny most resembles the movie character and had the most lines in the movie  the blue and purple ones did not do much at all in the movie  or as a dollthese are smaller than a barbie doll even though the destinies were full barbie size in the movie and made of hard plastic  they dont move at all and arent posable the sea horses come with a little stand on their back and the destiny doll clips into it loosely  which can be problematic  they arent very useful out of the water since they dont stand at all and certainly they dont float right in the watersince this purple destiny doesnt resemble the character in the movie isnt posable doesnt sit right falls out of the saddle easily and doesnt allow for you to change her clothes i dont rate this highly if your daughter really wants the destinies i would get the pink one only and be done with it|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|registeel was the first pokemon figure my daughter wanted from this line a few months ago given the original retail price and how good it looked it looked like a steal sure enough once she opened it the figure was great and she was super happy like ive said with the other regi figures these figures are worth it as long as you dont overpaythis figure has ball jointed arms so you can move them in circles which is very cool since the other two can only move theirs up and down you can move his legs a little too registeel doesnt need a stand hell be fine on his own they did a good job wit the paint on this one too though its still the slightly cheap paint thatll wear off fast but the quality of work that they put into painting it would please any collector who wants their figures to look as good as possible out of the boxmy only gripe is that they didnt articulate his innerbody the dark grey part that has his eyes on it moves up in the animated series and it wouldve been nice if they had done that too but registeel will please any fan of the characterso what are you waiting for go out there and get these guys they look great on the shelf and are a blast to play with|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|for the last  years or so nearly every pokemon figure thats come out has been pretty cheap paint jobs were poorly done limbs would fall off and sometimes the figure wouldnt really look like the pokemon its supposed to be thats still going on but it looks like this line of figures is trying to change thatregirock is a great little figure the sculpt is deadon the paint is clean and he has articulation at the arms and legs and the limbs dont fall off if you or your child loves pokemon and especially the regis this is a must i know its just a small figure but i couldnt believe how much better this guy is in the quality department compared to some figures that came out just a year ago the only problem the paint used for these figures tends to wear out fast after just a few uses as a bath toy some of the orange paint on regirocks shoulders is fading away but at five bucks you might as well get another for back up just in case hes that coolthis lines really impressed me so far with the quality and price hopefully we can get a few other overlooked pokemon soon|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|along with the great regi brothers series  brings us some eevee evolutions and like the regis all of them are worth picking up as usual im reviewing these figures based on the standard retail price which they should still be available at since these are all pretty new figuresjolteon looks just like he should lean pokey and ready to whoop some pokemon hes got that look on his face like he just found out his favorite show moved to a later time slot and hes ready to bring the pain jolteons legs are all moveable and none of them pop off like some of the earlier pokemon figures or those found in the plastic tube sets of  the points on his body arent sharp so your kids can play with this without potentially getting cut and like the other figures in the line jolteons a good size for what youre payingi dont have any complaints about this one weve had the figure for a few months and his paint hasnt rubbed off like regirocks didfor a fiver all of these pokemon toys are well worth the price and i wish i had gotten back into pokemon sooner to get the earlier releases my daughter absolutely loves each and every one and in the chance that one gets lost buying another isnt a blow to the wallet im glad theyre doing single releases for cheap instead of forcing you to buy a  or  figure set where you could end up buying it for just one cool pokemon|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|glaceons probably going to be the smallest figure of this line given the slim design it has going on but that doesnt take away from the figure one bit just like every other figure in this line its a great toy for your dollar and you wont find a better figure of glaceon in this sizeglaceon looks as she should with the flat tail and long strands of hair on the sides of her head shes also got a bit of a smirk makes you wonder what shes smiling about maybe a counter to stealth rock her legs and head are articulated and nothing falls off like all the others this is a sturdy figure unlike those made just a few years ago glaceon also has some good paint and ours has yet to have any spots rub off theres really nothing bad to say here this is another home runat the standard retail price these figures are a steal instead of buying sets just to get one you want you can just get the one pokemon you want on its own dont pass any of these up while theyre still available|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|its about time we get some good figures based on eevee and its evolutions i dont know why it took over  years but here we go like the regi figures i reviewed my rating is for the figure if you can get it at the standard price my daughter and i both love pokemon and some of her favorites include the eeveelutions as some call them flareon here was a sure thing to buy and once more im impressed by the quality put into this lil guyflareon has articulation in the head legs and tail the tail is really huge but doesnt make him fall over while standing this is the one piece youll have to watch out for as its held into the body by a small peg and could fall off i havent had that problem but it could happen the paint on this figure is excellent as is the sculpt i love how they gave it a more firey look instead of the poofy look of the original flareon design for some reason the paint on this figure seems to be a bit better than that on the regi brothers and none of it has faded or rubbed off yetwhile none of these figures do anything theyre great for kids with imaginations that like to make their own battles and play them out i highly recommend flareon to any pokemon fan or if you just want a neat colorful toy on your shelf|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|after my daughter got registeel and regirock i got anxious looking for regice my favorite of the regi group once i bought this bad dude i can easily say that hes probably the coolest of the  and keep in mind that my rating is for if you pay the regular price for him and not some inflated vendor price tooregice looks great he has pillars of ice sticking out of his back you can move his arms and feet and he looks exactly as he does in the game my first concern was how he was going to stand up since his feet arent like his brothers luckily he comes with a clear stand that lets him well stand youll need it too because hell end up falling over without it they did a good job with the paint as well though like regirock its kind of cheap and will wear off over time quicklyif you or your child is a fan of regice or just want a good pokemon figure look no further this line has impressed me a lot so far and i look forward to the next wave bring on torkoal and miltank|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|of all the pillow pets out there which one did my daughter want the pterodactyl not the ladybug not the puppy not the moose not even the panda no she wanted the pterodactyl it being her favorite dinosaur she was thrilled when we walked by a little booth that sold pillow pets and saw a pterodactyl one it looks like this guy is selling out at most stores and sites quickly so we had to hurry and get one before the price skyrocketed like some of the others by now most of you should be familiar with pillow pets big soft stuffed animals that can be used as pillows they feature a little strap on the side that has a velcro closure so you can bundle it up a little there are tons of different animals to choose from including some kinda obscure ones like what you see herethe pterodactyl looks great exactly as it does in the stock picture hes pretty big and just as cuddly as the other pillow pets the eyes are hard plastic probably the only thing here that could pose a threat to a small child and the teeth feel like a hard felt as to keep their shape the pterodactyl itself is made of super soft chenille but i wouldnt go by the machine washable instructions shown in the commercial for these the tag clearly says surface washable and i can see one of these falling apart after a couple of trips to the washing machine its also worth mentioning that because of the material if its used as a pillow the user will probably get hot while sleeping other reviewers for other pillow pets have mentioned waking up with a soaked pillow pet so maybe its better off a something to cuddle with still kids have a blast playing with these and dont be too surprised if they start having little pillow pet parties theres really nothing bad i can say about this guy aside from the inflated prices some people are listing it at the clerk at the pillow pet shop i got this from mentioned that the pterodactyl is a limited edition one so that could be the reasonthe fact that they made a pterodactyl pillow pet is rad in itself and the fact that its cutely ferocious is an added bonus if your kids like dinosaurs and want a pillow pet you cant do much better than this or the triceratops one i just might get one for myself because its so soft and puts all other pillows to shame|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|for the last couple of months my daughters been obsessed with dogs it didnt help when she noticed that we had nintendogs for ds and started playing the heck out of that midlast year she ended up getting all the mini plush nintendogs over time and this bark back chihuahua is kind of the big one of those its a simple stuffed dog with a few features that dont justify the inflated prices its now going for but since i got it for retail cost im reviewing it at that pricethe chihuahua is a pretty good size bigger than most real ones and probably weighs about the same it can stand on its own and is stuffed well aside from the tail which probably couldnt be the nose and eyes are plastic and look good and they went and added some fur in the ears to make it a little more realistic it also has a pink collar with the nintendogs paw print logo on the license when you squeeze its left ear the dog barks whines growls howls and then shakes its tail over the course of a few seconds thats all it really does but at the price point i wasnt expecting it to walk around or interact with other stuffed animals or anything but its good for what it is and my daughter was so excited when she opened the box he was in on jesusmas and she carried it around for most of the daythe only thing youll want to watch out for is getting the electronics wet if the dog gets dirty and you wipe it down with a damp cloth the stomach opens and closes with velcro and the tail contains wires of some kind that cause the tail to wag so just be careful with that and make sure it doesnt get wet at all and make sure the cloth isnt too damp so that the water goes down into the battery box areathis is a great toy and while it may not do a whole lot its sure to make any kid who loves dogs happy|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|im glad i got this figure this is a very odd and somewhat unstar wars like design for a snowtrooper the figure itself is well done with a great softgoods skirt i only wish the blaster were a bit more substantial  its more a pistol than the usual stormtrooper blaster rifle|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|so why is this one of the coolest star wars figures ever im not crazy i think this figure represent so much of what is so wonderful about the star wars collecting universe first the star wars universe is so big that even a character who was seen on screen for a fraction of a second has fans and his own backstory its a pretty compelling one at that second hasbro cares enough about star wars fans to make a figure of such a marginal character finally  and this is the best part  willrow hood is the result of one fan in particular lobbying hasbro to make the figure thats a pretty heartwarming story and i cant think of many other products that generate such loyalty on both sides the willrow hood figure himself is very well sculpted has lots of articulation and of course his infamous ice cream machine if youre a star wars collector dont pass this figure up|spam

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|these are great and come in many unique shapes  im used to the plain round pop beads so these were interesting to me  the only reason i took off a star is that not all the beads can go with all the others so kids have to do some trial and error work to make their jewelry sometimes  this is because not all the beads have the male end that snaps in  some only have two female parts so have to go between two beads with the male end to work|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|today was my daughters th birthday party she got a ton of great presents and seemed to enjoy every single thing she got from monster high dolls to disney infinity figures from teenage mutant ninja turtles toys to freakin gigan here seriously this is the toy that got the biggest smile from her and all the other kids who came over after she was done oohing and ahhing at gigan he quickly went to the other kids who all did the same thing and id be lying if i said i didnt gasp when i saw this toy for the first time too of all the  inch godzilla figures i think gigan may be the best one even better than the incredible mechagodzillaif you havent seen this toy in person yet theres only so much a written review can get through to you how this thing originally sold for a mere twenty bucks is beyond me the amount of detail here is insane from the ridges all over his body to the plates on his tail gigan is a sight to behold its hard to go back to the previous version after one glance at this one im sure godzilla super fans can find faults in the sculpt and say that some things are off but for a toy in this scale and at this price point its practically perfectarticulation is limited just like the others from this series you can move his arms up and down rotate the blades and move his legs a little bit too theres a tiny bit of articulation at the neck as well but its hardly worth mentioning given that these are all vinyl collectibles its no big deal gigan isnt going to be doing any gymnastics or anything i will mention that this toy shouldnt be played with by anyone under  years old because of how pokey it is all those spikes on gigans tail and the blades on his arms especially are kinda dangerous they arent sharp but if a kid holding this thing turned around real suddenly as another kid was behind them theres an accident just waiting to happen just be careful when handling this guy and everything will be ok just imagine if kevin from home alone had one of these when the burglars were breaking ini messed up and didnt buy him at the store when he first released so i had to go the online auction route i only spent a bit more than what he originally cost but the demand is still definitely there another run could always be released within the year especially now that a new godzilla movie is coming out either way hurry up and get one before prices sky rocket gigan makes for a great centerpiece of any toy collection|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i remember when i first saw wooper at a store either last year or the year before and i passed up on buying him figuring theyd have more in stock later on nope this little dude was one of the more popular ones and for an obvious reason hes so freakin cute wooper is basically an axolotl one of the coolest pets you could ever get but without arms come to think of it he almost looks like a mutated peanuts character hey hes still charming but i finally got my own wooper the other day and im proud to sport him on my shelfwhen my daughter doesnt nab him off the shelf to add to her pokemon at leastwooper looks perfect and is one of the better mini plush from the last couple of years mine isnt overstuffed anywhere and the materials used on him are of great quality the hornlooking things on his head are made of a thick felt and stick out perfectly stitching on the eyes and mouth looks spoton as do the marks on his stomach and of course he has his tail but it doesnt help him stand up so wooper will need to be propped up against something if you want to display it the colors are nice and help him stand out amongst the other mini pokemonthe only thing keeping him from getting  in the durability category is the hornthings while theyre made with quality they could be ripped out if mishandled or tugged a few times theyre sewn in pretty well but still theyre the only thing that could really break on woopernot much more to say i love this little guy and hes one of my favorites right next to torkoal and jirachi|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|although this set has a minimum recommended age of  we got it for our  year old because he loves the junkyard escape in toy story  and were willing to always play with him  we put this set together quickly using the easy picture instructions  the only challenging piece was the crane  it says to turn in counter clockwise once until it clicks but no matter how we turned it it didnt click and sometimes just started the turning action  it also doesnt stay very well when you pull the claw string back to attach itthe goodthis set has an amazing price  we were very surprised at the value  toy story  figurines by themselves start adding up and you get three with this setwoody lotso and an alien add in the dump truck that has retractable connectors so your child can drive it around and youre getting close to the price youd think youd pay  but theres so much morewe knew that our son would have a challenge doing the whole stunt sequence so after we ran it a couple of times for him we simply unsnapped the parts and let him play with them individually  he had a lot of fun with the claw mommy the claw saves them from the fire and with sending woody down the conveyor belt you wind up the conveyor belt and woody is carried to the end and dumped offour son put lotso on top of the box stunt piece and said the bad bear isnt going to press the button and hed have lotso scurry off  you would think hed have problems with things falling over but he didnt they stand alone pretty well  he liked storing the alien in the trash truck and driving off saying the trash truck is taking the alienwe have three other sets and we look forward to setting up a big chain reaction for our son  we figure that he will have fun for a few weeks playing with the individual parts then well hide the stunt sets for a while and bring them out when hes old enough to have lots of fun running the stunt show himselfthe badi almost wish woody had a stand because he doesnt stand independently on the conveyor belt you have to lay him down  lotso and the alien go down just fine thoughwhen setting up the full chain reaction you do find that you start partial sequences accidentally which means you have to start over  the bright side of that however is that you know each section trigger is sensitive enough that its going to keep working welli mentioned the down sides of the claw already but should say that he loves it anyway and likes to put characters in the claw to be carriedits really cute and our son really enjoys acting out and improvising the scenes from the movie and that means this is a superb buy for us at this price  not sure how frustrating the set would be if he were  and trying to set up the sequence though|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we got this for our  year old toy story fanatic  the minimum specified age is  but we knew hed love this set and we only let him play with it with us there  there were some strange warnings on amazon about choking parts and a marble and balloons but there is no marble nor balloons so were not sure what that was aboutthe andy play sequence at the beginning of the movie is his favorite and he has a dr evil pig spaceship and a train rescue set of figures as well  the thing i most appreciate about this set woody can actually ride bullseye  every other set out there that has a bullseye does not come with a character that sits on him  when you put woody on him he stays and even has cute ribbon reins  also theyre sturdy and dont fall overthe goodvery nice attractive plastic train set with many built in options for changing things up  the engine has cute rodcrank action on the wheels and the caboose has an easy press latch to send things flying  that and the caboose has a great little carry section on the back so that woody or bullseye can ride at the back of the train  our son is only  so we dont let him use the launcher on the nd car it has engine two cars and caboosehe opened a lot of other presents besides this one but this is the one he chose to play with all day  hes been all over the house with it all the while excitedly talking about moments in the movie or saying things like the train is going too fast dont fall off woodyincredibly fast setup  my husband had it ready in about  minutesthe okif my son takes the train on the rugs the cars become decoupled  its a simple peg and hole coupling and he has difficulty hooking them up so he gets frustrated when they come apart which happens if he goes on an uneven surface like going from hardwood floor to rug  if he were  i think hed be fine hooking and unhooking the cars so this may be a good case for waiting until your child is the recommended minimum age on the boxthe pictures show woody getting launched off the roof of the caboose but honestly woodys feet are tiny and the slightest movement makes him fall over  so he doesnt launch off the caboose well but i can attest that lots of other things dotrain sets out there are pricey so this was a great value especially at the amazon pricingalso this toy has great longevity because of the additional functionality  right now its just a train that woody and bullseye chase and ride but i expect that later he will have lots of fun reassembling the mega rig and doing some woody action scenes like using the launcher|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|jacen solo is obviously one of the most important characters in the expanded universe so its great to finally get a figure version of him this figure is pretty good probably around  stars the body is pretty much lukes bespin outfit but looks appropriate for the character the face is a good mix between han and leias which always seemed to me to look a bit like prince caspian from the chronciles of narnia the best part of course is the accessories jacen comes with several yuuzhan vong pieces including an amphistaff and other vong animals on his neck and wrist these pieces are incredibly detailed and really bring to life some of the scenes in matt stovers new jedi order book traitor unfortunately he cant hold the lightsaber very well in his right hand but it stays as long as you dont move him around much overall definitely a musthave figure for expanded universe fans|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|first thing ill say is that this figure looks much better in person than in the photos i almost didnt get it because i thought the head looked too cartoonish however i decided to give it a try in no small part for the th anniversary of the heir to the empire series im very glad i did when i took the figure out i was immediately impressed the head is based on the comic version of thrawn but its done well enough that he doest look like a comic book character thrawn has a chiseled stern look which captures his character perfectly the outfit is an offwhite color which holds up well in person and thrawn of course comes with his trademark yslamari which is beautifully detailedi do have a few small complaints nothing worth taking a star off but worth noting in case somebody from sideshow reads this first where are thrawns epaulets the grand admirals are notorious for having gold epaulets it would have made the costume complete second the yslamari has no articulation i realize its tough but maybe a more rubbery material would have worked better like yodas snakes finally the sleeves dont cover thrawns wrists when he bends his elbows i have the same problem when i wear business suits but maybe sideshow could update its prometheus body to cover the wrist joints a bit moreoverall this figure is a must for thrawn fans|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we bought this set a double curved set and one other switch piece on amazon from this vendor  the pieces all arrived in bubble packaging with each set in a zip sealed bag my  year old went crazy when he saw the pieces and he ran to his thomas train table and started building with them immediately my husband and i really loved watching him so excited but so concentrated biting his lip as he figured out how to use these pieces hed only had straight curved and bridge track before these pieces have expanded his track building universe in a rewardingly educational waythe thomasbranded wooden track is so expensive and the switch tracks rare  this is an affordable way to expand your track and it fits thomas sets flawlessly|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we started with a figure  thomas wooden coal track set and got expansion track sets  the thomas wooden branded track sets can be very expensive though and you can end up paying two dollars per track piece not only that but there are very few switch track piecestherefore i started looking into nonthomas branded tracks and was very happy to find this  at this low price you get two double curved switch tracks which gives you some great flexibility for expansion and fun i hoped they were true to their word that it fit thomas sets and they do very wellmy  year old had started out as just a conductor preferring to just move his trains around the tracks that we built about a month ago he started building his own tracks and loves to rebuild them every few days  these two pieces have given him so many more interesting options  he has been very excited to build with these though the complexity level has increased and he sometimes needs our help  but that is a wonderful thing  hes learning to deal with a higher level of complexity and thus learning from new challengesthe only down side is that he broke off one of the couplings within a few days  i dont blame the manufacturer  he was making a track and had already coupled this piece and was pulling it extremely taut to try to connect the track further down the line  i dont think any track could have withstood that the couplings on these seem the exact same as thomas tracks  with a little wood glue it was all fixed  that is the joy of wood track|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we received this as a present and liked that the hair grows and it has playability  its clear a lot of the production money must have been spent on having the longer grow hair than on the dress or accessories  the dress itself is the very plain cheap satin with very little in the way of interest in it  but the doll serves the purpose of looking like the movie character though missing the charm and personality  i like that you can store the accessories in the brush so they wont get lost as easilythis version is far superior to the rapunzel doll that comes with extra hair on a clip  that one feels really cheap  id highly recommend this oneif you want to get a really nice one there is a  same size disney version that looks much closer to the movie character and has more interesting hair more like the curly mess of the movie character|spam

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|if this were like other little people block sets that have the storage container where you can build on the lid this would have gotten  stars from me  the blocks are great for learning letters and basic shapes but you cant build structures of any kind  since theres no base or longer blocks you can only make single stacks  kids get board with that pretty quickly  it would have been better if these came in a container like the other sets and not the bag to allow for more building options  you could also make words that way by lining up the blocks instead of having to make the word vertical  it would be better for beginning readers since words are never vertical in books or anywhere else|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the action fleet tie defender this little ship is perhaps the most infamous and rarest in the action fleet line it came out soon after the pc tie fighter game which features the craft unfortunately it was almost impossible to find in stores i finally acquired two for a reasonable price and boy am i glad its a nice looking ship well sculpted you can remove one solar panel and flip another one so it looks like battle damage both features are done well and are integrated seamlessly with the main body of the ship i do wish the wings were slightly bigger as it would probably be better proportioned with the cockpit but other than that this is a great replica of the ship in the game this is a tough one to find so my only advice is that while its expensive you should be able to find one boxed for around a hundred dollars or so if you do find one get it|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|do you remember the first battle cat toy that came out in the early s i sure do it was one of my favorite toys when i was much younger and i still cant believe i found it at a garage sale for just a few cents for young kids battle cat was cool no matter what he had a ferocious look on his face the saddle and helmet were there and he looked great with the other motu toys yep battle cat made all the battles my toys had even better but when you look at that figure now nostalgia aside its kind of sad nothing is articulated and it just plain looks odd for a toy since it looks more like some kind of cheap tiger statue youd find at a cinco de mayo festival gift tent or a flea market battle cat got another chance at plastic immortality when the new heman show debuted and it looked goodbut was still a little lackingbut nowwe have the best version everbattle cat is one of the best figures in the motu classics line and always sells out whenever he comes back instock for a good reason the sculpt and articulation on this guy are top notch and i wish i could be  years old again to get even more joy out of this but i wont lie when i opened the shipping box and took battle cat out of the white collectors box i had a huge smile on my face theres nothing bad i can say about this figure you can move his jaw head neck upper body tail and each of his legs have several points of articulation as well the front two legs can be moved at the shoulder forearm and anklewrist and the back legs can be moved at the upper leg knee ankle and paw all points of articulation on my figure were tight with no problems and you can get the big green dude into some really cool poses aside from the standard prowling pose hes usually seen in both the helmet and saddle are easily removable with the saddle being removed simply by undoing the strap on the bottom the helmet just slips onto battle cats head and stays on without being too tight i was worried about the helmet possibly rubbing off the paint on battle cats face over time but its unlikely to happen with how perfectly it fits heman with his weird legs has no problem sitting in the saddle eitherif youre a longtime motu fan youll love this figure if you have kids that watch the show of course theyll love this heck my daughters only seen one episode of heman but watched most of shera and shes constantly playing with battle cat having him protect her other toys from monsters and demons get this figure directly from mattel if you can he shows up instock every now and then for the original price and sometimes on sale but even if you pay double the original price i feel its worth it battle cat makes an excellent addition to anyones toy collection|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this does have some drawbacks but it is good solid fun for young kids  it plays two tunes my little pony theme and a caribbean theme has castle horn sounds and has a rotating swing set at the top of the castle  it also lights up  all are controlled with the same single button  so you will have to push multiple times if you want to eg move the rotating swingsbut it has some heavy drawbacks that could very much frustrate younger kids  ponies are top heavy with the tail and fall over easily  whether in the set or on their own  nor do they really sit in anything easily  although they have the hole in the bottom to help keep them on pegs on various items on the playset they dont stay in the pegs and fall over easily  not even i as the parent could get them to stay  i could barely get them to stand on their own  and well they have hollow arms which is kind of disturbing actually  the seal that comes with the set has a peg hole in the bottom so he will stay on items  however if you buy the companion ponies and their friends separately eg the one with the dolphin the friends do not have pegs  we bought the pony with the dolphin and the dolphin doesnt sit in anywhere  he just flops over stupidly  if you put the ponies in the rotating swings they tend to flop over and block the thing from working catch on a piece of the castle  the set makes horrible noises when that happens  the shell sits in a peg and is very stiff to open  trying to pry it open usually results in knocking it off of the peg which frustrates my  year oldi have a very patient kid and she becomes easily frustrated with this set  things dont stay in place fall off dont work or arent compatible with all accessories etc  but it does have good play value in that it moves plays music etc|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the cloud car isnt one of the most popular vehicles but it has its fans fortunately theyll be quite pleased with this new cloud car the last time hasbro released a toy cloud car was   almost  years ago this one is quite a looker its a simply vehicle but hasbro took the time to make it well and it shows the most important thing is that there are absolutely no decals hasbro either painted or sculpted all features including the controls inside the cockpit also while hasbro usually decides to ruin its star wars vehicles by adding on firing missiles and other play features hasbro treated the cloud car a bit more respectfully probably because it realized collectors would be the ones who primarily bought this vehicle the cloud car does have a few firing missiles for the kids but theyre discretely hidden within the pods of each car the missile launchers only appear if you push the cars closer together in other words if you just want a movieaccurate model of the cloud car you never have to see the missile launchers  just pretend they dont exist the one tiny complaint i have is the landing gear it sticks out a bit when put up it seems like there should have been a way to make it a bit less obtrusive its not a problem from most angles but still overall this is an awesome vehicle with a few features for the kids but high quality for collectors|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i think ive figured it out regarding the protests in egypt its not just because of the things the president over theres done but ive reached the conclusion that hes the one that approved of something that has driven parents crazy since its releasemoon doughi almost got this for my daughter a few months ago for jesusmas but checked reviews of it before buying and saw the pictures customers put up on here showing the aftermath of playing with moon dough see im not the kind of parent who flips out when a mess has been made or cringes when their child plays with something that takes a while to pick up after but moon dough goes beyond the tolerance of a tibetan monk especially this magic barnyard play set the only magic here is the magic of losing money on this black hole of absurditytake a look at the box for this you get  colors of moon dough white blue and yellow some little plastic molds of farmrelated things like a fence and the barn which is where you can make animal shapes with the moon dough now heres the thing on paper this sounds like a great idea while using a standard cookie cutterlike shape to just press into the dough and get your animal would work just as well here you pack in some moon dough through the top of the barn where animal molds are then crank a lever on the back of it it turns a wheel that churns out an animal through the doors of the barn or at least thats what its supposed to do in the hour and a half that my daughter and i spent trying to get something out of this play set we successfully made  sheep  chickens and a few animals that looked like sheer abominations  of the time the moon dough would get stuck in the wheel just past the doors yeah somehow regardless of how tight or loose you pack the dough into the animal molds the piece will still get stuck and not go through the doors so when it comes down to it you have this huge barn play setthats just really used to shape a few animals if youre lucky the crank on the back constantly breaks off since its not fastened on the wheel itself will sometimes get stuck inside the barn even without moon dough in it and the separate mold pieces like that wonderful wonderful fence one take a few seconds to get the dough out yes whoever designed this toy was having a midlife crisis and wanted to take innocent children and their parents with themso how about the moon dough well you can see for yourself in the customer images i was going to put my own up but itd look identical to those already there the dough crumbles a lot but always retains the same semisticky feel it definitely feels better than playdoh but isnt in the same class as that classic at first i was worried when i took the packets of moon dough out of the box and saw how broken up everything looked as i was expecting it to be like playdoh and have some shape to it then you mold it or break it up from there nope it just shatters all over the place once you open the packet and god save you if you or one of your kids open this for the first time on carpet then step on it according to the directions youre supposed to squeeze the moon dough for a little bit kneading it like dough or something in order to make it stay together better it works but that lasts for a few seconds before you break off a piece and dozens of tiny pieces go along with it the only thing i can compare the messes that moon dough brings is if youve ever used one of those big metal hole punchers that can do  holes at once on sheets of paper and how the punched pieces go in the hole puncher you slide out a tray and all the paper dots are in there if youve ever spilled one of those on the floor thats exactly how moon dough looks when its all said and doneim giving the educational value of this  out of  because it teaches kids what a ripoff is i feel im being fair when i give this thing one star for fun as well since my daughter never asked to play with it again after the first time and i sure didnt have any fun with it either the fact that i gasped and felt accomplished when i successfully made a moon dough chicken should say something the durability gets a  but thats mostly because the actual barn is wellmade but everything else isnt like the crank base and more kinda sad that the plastic mat that comes with this is the one thing that doesnt disappoint last year the worst toy i saw was the toy story alien fishing game but if i had gotten this  months ago moon dough wouldve easily beat it out|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i really like that scrabble has been updated with modern technology scrabble dates back to the s after alland so a whole new twist on the game can be played theres no board now  just electronic tiles  players have  seconds to shuffle and slide their electronic cubes to create words before the time runs out each of the five scrabble flash cubes letter tiles has smart tile technology so that each one recognizes the letters placed next to it and automatically keeps score and checks if the word is spelled correctlywhile traditional scrabble fans will probably stick with the board game since a lot of the board strategies are no longer valid with scrabble flash such as leftover tile strategies and doubletriple word score challenges scrabble flash game is great for casual play  it provides a way for families to play together with several challenges aimed directly for family play and parents can work on ways to make it age appropriate for all family members eg under  need only to get  letter words  have to get  letter words and  have to get  letter wordsthe game also provides a nice outlet for solitaire play  something the board game doesnt do that well  you dont need a computer to challenge yourself any longerthese use coin sized lithium batteries and dont look to use too much power so id expect them to go a long time before you have to replace the batteriesin all a very cool update of scrabble that is very portable and suitable for scrabble enthusiasts as well as the casual family players|spam

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this is a really cute fun and interesting toy for little ones  i thought at first that the weebles would fall off the escalator but they dont  i like how they go from the escalator to the slide and back to the escalator whithout anyone having to put them back on  its a continuous motion as long as the crank is being turned  this toy is a huge hit at our house|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the weebles treehouse is cute simple and entertaining i got it for a month old niece but my year old niece saw it and really liked it im not quite sure why but this was a big hit with both girls it seems kids anywhere in that range could have fun with it its pretty safe has no small parts and is easy for toddlers to operate even the crank is fairly easy i appreciated the color scheme with lots of bright greens yellows and reds and needless to say its a big toy  much bigger than it looks in the picture  which is always exciting for kids id definitely recommend this set especially if your toddlers already have weebles|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i want to start the review by saying i love that playskool redesigned the weebles back to being eggs with paper inserts of faces i had grown up with weebles as my favorite toy and was disappointed when my daughter was born a few years ago and the weebles no longer looked like weebles  they were plastic figures with a round bottom  but now they are back to being the fun little eggs that little ones like to push and roll and the expressions on the faces can be that much more funalso important to note is that this is a large set  much bigger than it looks in the picture  but it is also compact for storage  its tall and not wide so you dont take up floor roomour  year old went nuts over this  the bright colors play areas working knobs and little hiding places for the figures  he had no problem with the crank and getting the weebles to go up the stairs  and of course when they slide down and triggered the songs he would dance along with them proudlyanother favorite way to play with the toy was that he would put them inside the tree home and play house  wed get to knock on the door to see if they were home or hed push the button to play music for them  in all the tree house kept him entertained for hours on end  he didnt want to go to sleepthe tree house has a large crank that brings the weebles up the stairs  at the top they automically slide down the slide and end up at the bottom of the stairs again  when they hit the bottom they trigger the music to play a little ditty  theres also a little hang out at the top of the tree and a home inside the base of the tree  in all quite a bit of play areas in a compact size  perfect for little ones and with few pieces to losebut best of all the weebles are back to the original designs of the s  just larger sized for safety|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i really like this toy  it is very educational and uses positive reinforcement which is more than i can say for other toys i have seen like this  instead of just saying no or wrong when the wrong answer is chosen it stays very positive and encouraging  my only suggestion for playskool is for them to include some kind of plastic plate to protect the cards when theyre in the robot so they dont get ruined  i ended up purchasing some of the booster packs of cards so that my kids can get the most learning out of this  i recommend it for sure|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|my kids have this and the busy gears and love both  this is especially fun because it rolls and the gears make a cool noise while it does  my yearold just loves rolling it but my yearold has found other uses  she loves to take the  gear things off and make a tower with them on the floor  she then knocks into the tower with the rolling critter  she finds it hilarious  all in all this toy is worth buying for the different ways to play with it|spam
A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|i think this is a good accessory to go with the treehouse but not as good as a stand alone  it spins when you push down on the top and thats about it  my yearold loves it because she loves anything that spins but my older  play mainly with the treehouse and use this as a playground for the weebles to go to  i do like that no batteries are required|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the masters of the universe toys were some of my favorites as a kid along with teenage mutant ninja turtles and ghostbusters as much as i liked the motu classics line when it was first announced i didnt have any plans to buy them because i knew there were so many characters id want to get and im already bad enough with my vinylmation collection somehow my daughter watched a few episodes of shera and heman when i was at work one night and soon she had a motu classics shera i was impressed with the figureand now im getting into the line myself moss man is the first regular figure ive picked up and this guy has exceeded my expectations you know youre in for a treat when the white collectors box he comes in has a super strong pine smell to itmoss man stands at about  inches tall and has the same muscular body that  of the figures in this line use it has great articulation neck shoulders elbows wrists torso waist upper legs knees and ankles too everything moves without any trouble though the upper leg movement is a little restricted because of his plastic loincloth as far as accessories go he doesnt come with a whole lot theres the alternate head with a more neutral expression on it a knife that you can remove from his vine purse thingy and his scepterwannabe gaffi stick the knife looks kind of goofy when you have him hold it since its so small so i go with the scepter i wouldve liked an extra open left hand to give a little more variety in moss mans poses but its nothing that hurts the score having two head sculpts is always a great bonus and moss mans unique from the other motu figures in that hes flocked more or less this means that hes fuzzy to give him that mosslike look though it looks more like he has really thick body hair and gave everything a buzz cut which also makes me hope that that is a loin cloth on top of this moss man has a nice pine smell that to some people is very strong i dont have much of a sense of smell so it doesnt bother me but the white box definitely had a strong odor to it and i threw that sucker out as soon as i took him out of the packagingive got moss man displayed with my mcfarlane where the wild things are figures in a pose similar to maxs since he can do it and has a similar scepter this is a fun toy and kids and adults alike can get a lot out of it|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the tonner harley quinn doll stands nearly twice as high as a regular barbie doll and is proportionately thicker  the materials for her costume are all very well made  cloth stretch leotard crip ruffed wrists stuffed justers hat and soft pompom details at the neckthe doll comes with long blonde hair that comes out from the back of the costume  so she is not really displayable from the side easily  but it means you can fold back the hat and remove the mask to get the blonde harlene quinzel figure to show from beneath the evil costumethe face has a nice sculpt and she has greyish eyes on white porcelain skin  the mask shoes gloves and rest of the accoutrements are removable  giving you a lot of ways to pose her  she doesnt come with any accessories which admittedly takes away a bit from the lunatic harley flavor  she now just looks determined rather than bat crazythe cinched waist bustier and shiney leatherette boots are admittedly detractions  they just dont sit right with the rest of the harley quinn outfit perhaps a bit too sexy for the ingenue personality  if i had to describe this doll it would be harley in  years after the batman animated series  shes older and she means businessin all the size and articulation make this a great purchase  no one will confuse her with a barbie doll and you can make your own props to give her a bit of flair  i definitely dont regret the purchase and my  year old daughter who loves the show gives it a high thumbs up as a display piece as well|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|this was a pretty weird thing to see at the toy store a few months ago a board game based on gremlins with little gremlins and a little gizmo as the game pieces where was this thing when i was little this is a cute little game aimed at kids and their families though i guess it appeals to some collectors too if youve got children or brothers and sisters to play board games with this is a simple one thatll definitely stand out from the others like monopoly and crocodile dentistthe game comes with  figures gizmo stripe and  other gremlins cards instructions and the game board which is actually just a folded piece of paper with squares on it for traps and the exit its for two people one person playing as gizmo and the other as stripe if youre gizmo you win by making it to the exit square or destroying stripe if youre stripe you win by destroying gizmo or moving stripe or any gremlin piece onto the square gizmos on players take turns drawing cards and moving the number of spaces as directed the trap spaces are pretty selfexplanitory if a piece lands on the trap space that piece is taken out of the game until its over yeah like i said above this is a simple game that pretty much anyone can play regardless of their ageim giving it  stars for education since this would be a good board game to get any younger kids started on teaching them to take turns go by the rules count spaces to move etc not very educational or anything but its something the durability is average since the board is just basic paper folded up a few times and the cards arent very thick either the game pieces are done well though not highly detailed as some sites claim all of the gremlins look identical aside from a hat mohawk mask or accessory if they have one but these are tiny pieces so its understandable and the price is pretty good for this too though you can get some much bigger board games for a buck or two more either way its still not a bad deal and do i need to bring up again that this is a freakin gremlins board gamegremlins fans dont have much merchandise these days and this board game is definitely one of the more unique things to come out in a while its simple to play and best for kids  and under but itd be a fun thing for parents to play with their kids if theyre both fans of the movie and hey you can always use the little figures as pieces in other games gremlins in candyland genius|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|tonner created the dreary siblings  a sort of emo goth family of youngsters for the modern generation doll collector  one of the last siblings to be added was this doll  breather drearybrother dreary is a large doll  nearly twice the size of barbie doll and quite wider  since he is fully articulated he can be arrangedposed in quite a few interesting positions  this makes him a very good decorative piece since you can change the way he looks all the time and keep him freshdrearys outfit is very quality  a black cotton chinese inspired frogged buttons top and matching loose pants  underneath is a grey cotton undershirts  he comes with appropriate black hairi dont have the other dreary dolls but purchased this one because of the long hair the outfit is appropriately dreary but admittedly far too much on the bland side for me  id rather have a bit of mystery and quirkiness in the character and the outfit just doesnt have any of that at all  honestly the outfit just makes him look dull  im looking forward to redressing him i will have to buy male clothes from tonner due to the size of the dollthe face sculpt is lovely and the hair is especially fine  really its the hair that makes this doll since it can be hard to find male dolls with mid length hairin all i was pleased with the purchase but rate this  out of  stars because dreary doesnt have to mean dull as the other dolls in the dreary line demonstrate with their outrageous goth fashions|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|neca did a really good job with the stripe and gizmo figures and the poker player gremlin too i guess basically stripe minus the hair and with new accessories but they really knocked it out of the park with mohawk the first time i saw this guy in the store i mustve looked over the figure for  minutes this is easily one of the best figures necas ever done that ive seen and looks just as great as their full scale statue of mohawk that came out a few years ago not only does he get a much better paint job but this sucker is huge and makes stripe look like a pipsqueak if you have them next to eachother mohawk is still easy to find at stores that carry these so dont go paying double retail just yet though to be honest if i had to i wouldnt be too mad if i paid that much since its such a great looking figuremohawk looks just like he does in the stock picture but better when you get to see him up close and see how well they did with painting all the spots different colors that fade in and out and tiny details on his face why couldnt some of my head knockers by neca have such great paint his sculpt is spoton with the puppet in gremlins  and as great as the front looks you gotta love the attention to detail with the back of his shoulders this dude has an unsettling smirk and im much happier with this expression over something like a sneer or anything showing his teeth i also love how the black pattern around his mouth looks like a goatee you can get some very nice poses out of mohawk thanks to the articulation he can move his head to the left and right has ball jointed shoulders cut elbowsforearms and wrists and you can move the legs up and down too hes very sturdy as a whole and the only thing that knocks the durability rating down a star is that his mohawk spikes and the spikes on his back can come off pretty easily when youre posing him so take them off before posing to save you the hassle but once hes set he looks radmohawks lone accessory in this series is the chemical that turned him into a huge spider it looks good but he cant hold it because of his fingers but its nice to have next to him on the shelf what bugged me was that the cult classics version of mohawk came with a lab desk base but its missing here in the offchance that youre able to get either version for the same price go with that one just because its always nice to have an additional accessory usually id knock the score on a figure for something like this but seriously this thing looks too good to give anything less than  starsyes i realize im coming off as an excited little kid over the figure but its that good whats funny is that i gave gizmo and stripe pretty good ratings but after getting mohawk i almost want to lower their ratings for not being anywhere near as good as him it looks doubtful but im hoping that neca continues the gremlins line and gives us the spider mohawk rambo gizmo and a few other gremlins like the crossdresser and maybe the bat one too many possibilities with this line and itd be such a nice change of pace over seeing the same jasonfreddymyers figures on the shelves next to the gremlins all the time|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|fuzzoodles didnt seem like much fun when i looked over the box in stores a few months ago but when my daughter got to try them out with my sisters recently she had a blast making her own monsters of course i gave in and ordered this set as a result its a heck of a lot cheaper on amazon than it is in stores of course and it looked like it came with a good amount of parts to make your own monsters with after opening the box im glad i didnt pay more than what i did for this kit as it doesnt have a ton of different pieces by any meansbut was it still fun yeah to an extent but ill tell you right now that youre better off getting two different kits in order to get more out of this idea people who have experience making sock puppets with pipe cleaners as horns antennas or whatever will have no trouble making creatures here but those new to it might end up breaking the pieces shortly after taking them out of the boxsimply put the main body pieces for the fuzzoodles are just oversized pipe cleaners theyre not short feather boa like a few pictures make it seem and the fuzz on them isnt that long like the illustration on the box might lead you to believe theyre as durable as regular pipe cleaners and can take a good number of extreme bends before being at risk of breaking you also get a couple of different mouths eyes ears feet and hands but like the product details on this page says you only get  pieces in the box for body parts yep  total so much for this being a large construction kit huh there are also  of the fuzzoodle pipe cleaner pieces which i guess are supposed to be the fuzzoodles themselves last theres a booklet with some creature creation ideas if you somehow cant think of anything to make on your ownits simple to make these guys even if you dont have experience making things like this youll have to twist the pipe cleaners in order to get the body parts on since they have little hooks to go on the fuzzoodles if you just make an upside down u shape there piece will just slide off so you need to have a more solid area hard to really explain here but youll get it when you try it out to me the pieces stayed on without any problems and getting them on was easy you just need to make sure you dont twist the fuzzoodles too tightly the best creations my daughter and i made were ones that used up most of the fuzzoodles just to make one monster with four legs these would also make for some great holiday decorations be it things to hang from the ceiling on halloween or ornaments for jesusmasoverall this is a pretty fun product but it needs to come with more especially when you look at the original retail price but at the moment its a good deal i have to stress that youre better off getting this and another different kit though so youll have more pieces to work with i like this since it helps kids with learning to make their own creations by using their imaginations and would be a good introduction to making puppets while the box says ages  and up kids  shouldnt have any trouble making a cool monster just too bad it didnt come with a few extra things like feathers pom pom balls or something else|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i was on the fence about getting into the revoltech figures for a few months but bit the bullet after seeing some great shots of gamera the revoltech lines known for pretty detailed sculpts and incredible articulation putting a lot of highend  scale figures to shame in that category seeing gamera in more than the standard hunched over pose was a sight to behold and i ordered him along with giant robo even then i felt iffy for paying so much for a figure thats barely  inches tall but once i opened the box all was well in the cosmos this figure rocks godzilla fans people new to revoltech or toy collectors who just want something coolthis figure is a must have theres just two problems that keep him from being a perfect figurebut first the good things about good ol gamera here the sculpt is just plain great and of all the gamera figures ive seen over the years this is easily the best one i still cant believe they managed to get a figure this small to look just like the suit used in the movies wrinkles in the legs plates on the shell tiny teeth everythings here and its spoton i love how the ball joints are so wellhidden by the different parts of gamera and the only ones that you can see most of the time just barely are the shoulders even then its not an eye sore the paint on my figure is equally great with no slop anywhere revoltech does a heck of a job and certain companies cough neca cough could learn a thing or two from them gamera also comes with several accessories an additional lower body stump without legs rocket feet to go into said stump a fireball two extra closed hands a little orange box to keep the hands in a name plate and an orange chip worth  points on revoltechs site to get prizes but you can only redeem these if you live in japan the fireball fits in his mouth through a hole in the back and looks rad when displayedthe articulation on gamera is killer you can move the following areas mouth neck shoulders elbow wrists hands torso it can snap forward a little upper legs knee feet and three sections of the tail the head can also be moved a tiny bit but the neck will be doing all the work here everything moves easily and the hands and lower body are easily swapped out without the worry of breaking provided you arent rough while doing so i was really impressed by the tails articulation they couldve been lazy and had it be one solid piece but its three separate pieces simply put gameras going to be doing all kinds of cool poses thanks to the articulation i currently have my gamera screaming to the heavens with in a darth vader nooooo poseok im praising this figure but am only giving it  stars overall why well the obvious thing is the size gameras a lot smaller than the other godzilla monsters by revoltech and while i know he wasnt one of the bigger monsters in the movies its lame seeing him dwarfed by the revoltech woody from toy story even an extra inch wouldve made this guy better but i cant complain too much since they did such a great job on the sculpt i guess its just me being used to bigger figures the other thing though is a big problem the pegs on the rocket feet attachment can break off very easily i was careful when putting them in the stump lower body and had them in there but when i carefully pulled them to swap the regular legs back in the pegs got stuck in the lower body and i couldnt get them out again i took great caution when trying to remove these but the rocket feet attachment is made of a softer plastic and youll need great care herebut as it is i love this figure and have had a lot of fun posing it over the last couple of days another gamera is coming out very soon based on the original costume and it features spinning rocket legsarms but between the two i prefer this one by far its all about the fire breath get this guy and have him terrorize a village of pokemon figures|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|synopsis of below info for timeconstrained folks fun for all cleanup of product is about half an hour inside and ten minutes when used outside sand was easy to net at first but then transformed somehow and resisted capture via the included net so just use fist set includes four  ounce bottles we lost  of an ounce through several general play sessions wash hands after usethis stuff is just as much fun as it was for me about thirty years ago particles do float on the top of the water but this does not and did not for me when i did not have crows feet detract from the fun another helpful reviewer clued me into the fact that the tank that came with the themed sets was very small so i purchased this above set at toys r us can only get this set there and decided to use big clear glass bowls that i already own and for the purpose of maximum viewing excitement my kids a newbie three and a jaded seven had a blast colors get promptly mixed into a dazzling rainbow so if you are a purist forget this stuff i provided a plastic fork and a long dairy queen spoon for whichever child did not grab the rakespoonnet thingy first therefore both kids would have implements to shape the sand yes you can use your mitts in fact this is more fun now please engage the soundtrack for the prek cleanup songthank you let me first state that if you are a clean freak this sand was not that hard to remove from my kitchen in general removing real beach sand from rugrats and beach supplies is actually more difficult anyway this was my cleanupplay method i laid out a big old towel and rags for any spills on my kitchen table kids played then abandoned me after washing hands the sand leaves a dry powdery film on your hands i began to remove the sand from the water by alternating skimming particles from the top with the little net thingy and using what i call the white shark method scooping up the sand from the bottom and pulling my net straight up to contain the sand that i had just grabbed while also picking up any loose sand floating on the surface indirectly killin two birds with one stone if there were any water droplets on top of my netted sand i would encourage them to descend to the bottom of the net by gently tapping the net on the side of the bowl or i just let gravity do its thing you can see the droplets exiting the bottom of the net you can also pile up the dregs of the sand and place it right into your net underwater in order to remove even more just dont get ocd about salvaging every bit of sand or you will be there all day the funnel works great after getting the sand back in the bottles i poured the water outside and wiped the bowls with paper towels to remove extra particles i then shook out the towel outside wiped sand off my table onto my kitchen floor cleaned the chairs swept up and voila i was done it seemed to take only twenty minutes but i will time my cleanup method the next time we play with this stuff and give an update plus we lost a lot less sand than i thought we would only like three teaspoons worth i noticed that one parents review stated that her kids needed help another reviewer was disappointed that her fouryearold was not able to cleanup the mess herselfhey its not like i sat there the whole time bonding deeply with my brats but i was at least hovering by them and helping my threeyearold from time to time and i do not expect my kids to make my domicile look like a pottery barn catalog pic in other words i was not expecting the sand to babysit my kids i cannot afford the sands fee anyway hee heeupdateextra tidbits several days later i mentioned in the above review that i would time my cleanup method the purpose of this is in order to inform people who do not want to spend a lot of time cleaning up whether or not they should purchase this product well my cleanup time was increased it took me  minutes and  seconds to cleanup during this latest aqua sand episode i included in my timing traveling to the laundry room to get rid of dirty and clean rags going back a second time to the laundry room cause i forgot my dustpanbrush cleaning two kitchen chairs washing the utensils and bowls wiping down my counter and putting my kitchen table back in order as it doubles as grand central station only the action of cleaning the chairs was included in my original time estimate of twenty minutes only one child played with the aqua sand this time the threeyearold and she can go either way with messes total chaos or welcome to the brady residence we are orderly she was the latter during this session we also lost less sand this time one and a half teaspoons within the water and on the table a fourth of a teaspoon on the floor i noticed that there were more particle islands floating on the surface of the water this time these can be rescued by pushing the little island into the water where it then becomes a scoopable small blob of sand i also want to mention here that both of my kids have placed the tip of the sand bottle in the water when ejecting the sand and there have been no negative effects as of yet i will update this review if i discover any more viable inforecently discovered viable info day later aqua sand is indeed sand and not sandpaper grit iegarnet aluminum oxide as conjectured by one reviewer it did not scratch my kitchen table which can be easily scratched as it is a black matte sdinerstyledeal disagreeing with same reviewer one reviewer was very upset that when her daughter received the mermaidthemed aqua sand set the mermaid contained within was totally different a rep at aqua sand told this reviewer that shehe should have opened the box before purchase and said reviewer was shocked by this suggestion in defense of aqua sand and people like me who remove the elastic band holding new shoes together in target you can totally open packaging to check items out within certain limits i have seen everything from underwear packages to dish sets with fooledwithtogainentry packaging in target two weeks ago a young woman opened a moisturizer set to view the goods this doesnt mean that im trying on the deodorant when i check to make sure that the plastic dome is intact im just protecting myself as a consumer in defense of the mermaidset reviewer how would she have known to inspect the set due to the possibility that a totally different meramid could be inside that is definitely upsetting to some kids and aqua sand should be upfront about what is or possibly contained within their sets i know it is possible that the box may carry the statement contents may vary in some obscure place in tiny lettering some people are freaking out about the safety of aqua sandhey this stuff has been used in educational applications aimed at kids since god knows when so doncha think that if there are any health hazards from being exposed to this stuff that we would know by now please i implore you you do not have to cry every time you see a box of life cerealmikey is alive and playing with aqua sandthe aqua sand saga continues  we were using this stuff outside yesterday the temperature was about the same as it was when we were using this stuff indoors due to a gas heater in kitchen when my daughter was pouring the sand into the bowl i could see a fine powder being blown away by the breeze after playtime i had a hard time separating the sand from the water within the net huge droplets of water were not easily removed from the net and seemed impervious to my previous removal methodology i had to resort to trying to remove the water droplets via my fingers acting as a scoop very tedious and then just letting some drops remain within the net because they were too difficult to remove i dumped the sand with included tiny drops into the bottle then i would tip the bottle with quarterturns in every direction to get out what water i could there were still small water drops within the bottle that i could not remove no matter what i did this whole new dimension to sand removal was a little more painful i am not sure if the fine powder that i saw floating away was an additive to the sand that somehow allows smaller water drops to flow more freely away from the sand or if it was just finer particles of the sand floating away my net does not seem clogged with any substance i will report later if i have any more sandwater removal problems on a nonwindy day of playand whether or not the water droplets that are within the sand bottles have a negative effect although i think that that is no biggie taking away one overall star for now cause the newly discovered above quirk was a pain in the butt for an overloaded parentyes i am cracked final notes on  used outside again on a day much like the above before my daughter poured out the stuff i peeked in one bottle to determine exactly how water drops that are trapped within the bottles affect the sand the water drops that i examined within one bottle had an oily sheen and looked a bit slimy plus the water drops do not evaporate as i had previously thought or at least do not evaporate quickly play was still fun but there was still a lot of particles floating on the surface of the water sand removal this time was simpler due to the fact that i eschewed the net and used my fistyep the sand was still resistant to my futile netting attempts all in all cleanup was actually easier than it has ever been due to the fist method and maybe the water drops that are trapped within the bottles do indeed affect the sands preformance overall stars remaining the same due to fun and my new cleanup method one last note for infoheads we have lost a quantity of sand which equals  of an ounce discovered this tidbit with digital cooking scale|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|i purchased these dolls for my fouryearold daughter because she was so entranced with her older sisters wooden matroyshkas there was a small accident one day and a member of the matroyshka family bit the dust i knew these matroyshkas were plastic so i decided to go for it as you can see this set is adorable strangely enough the smallest gal opens as well but she does not have an unopenable chick inside her as most matroyshka sets have the last doll never opens sturdy not flimsy at all as one person mentioned not cheaply made either paint job is good i will try to update this review if the paint scratches off easily however sorry dudes and i do believe that someone mentioned this as well they do not close as snugly as i like note wooden ones close snugly humidity skin oils toddlers and time are all potential destroyers i have never seen wooden matroyshkas splinter just crack in the above mentioned accident a small nonsharp piece of wood broke off i gave it a shake test while all dolls were nesting and all bottoms plunged to the floor when i asked my fouryearold to take it to her dad testing purposes she shook it and the same result transpired i am mentioning this because i know that to some people this will be annoying when it is picked up in a regular fashion while nesting the bottoms do not fall off i like this set because of its uniqueness while still retaining the traditional look but i would also seek out a wooden set with an included nanny to pick up the plastic matroyshkas butts hee hee listen the wooden ones are safe but not as strong as plastic i have never seen matroyshkas with thick paint peel or chip off my fouryearold destroyed her sisters matroyshka when i wasnt watching her in russia matroyshkas are probably like barbies and thousands upon thousands have been destroyed up unto this minute because parents need mental breaks and said parents just deal with the fact of potential destruction i have never heard of matroyshka poisoning or matroyshka staking so i am guessing here that russian kids have survived constant contact with these dolls while the dolls might not survive constant contact with kids whew i got this set so my kid could experience the wonder of matroyshkas without me hovering but dropped bottoms now have us both hovering over spill sites see below equations for switzerlandish conclusionsplastic matroyshkas  bottoms  some adult freedom  wowwooden matroyshkas  bottoms  watching  wow|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ever since chrono trigger first came out in the mid s ive wanted action figures of the characters id always think up cool features for what they would have like robo having a shooting hand or lucca being a cap based figure like the old robocop ones and sparks would shoot out of her or something heck i even went the extra mile and drew up plans for a lavos playset that wouldve been like the mighty max toys and yet nothing came out even with squares play arts line doing extremely well no figures from chrono trigger came out what do we get instead little figures based on some of the artwork from the game that was featured in magazines and the official players guide by nintendo power while its nice that we finally got something poseable figures wouldve been much better especially considering how much this set runs foryou can see in the picture that you get  figures crono defending against magus lucca repairing robo robo swinging his first around on a chain while crono and ayla look puzzled and crono and frog walking through a damp cavern the figures are all around  inches tall and sculpted fairly well for the size theres some things that look weird like cronos hair in the magus one but you cant expect a whole lot from something like this they have great paint jobs and no messes anywhere honestly it is pretty cool finally getting to see some of the characters in toyform but id only recommend these for the die hard fansmy main problems are the price and lack of variety pricewise these are not worth what theyre currently going for i suggest waiting until they go on clearance regardless of the limited in the item description that most people list these as think about it the play arts auron is still available most places freakin auron the coolest character in ffx from one of the first play arts sets that came out years ago and hes still around for the regular price so i doubt youll have trouble finding this set in a few years as for variety youre getting  cronos here i know these are all based on some of the more memorable art pieces but there were a lot they couldve chosen instead or even completed some of these by adding the rest of the characters from the scene theyre from like robo leading crono and frog from the cavern one while little monsters are all around them or the rest of the gang kicking back while lucca fixes robo and frog falls over some booksstill it could be a lot worse these figures look pretty good but theyre overpriced save your money until theyre halfoff|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|im not really a fan of the twilight movie so dont really have a vested interest in jacob or edward  but even i was quite impressed with how well done this doll isjacob is fully articulated  you can pose him in as many ways as you like  and he is quite large  nearly twice the size of a barbie and quite wider  no one will confuse this with a little girl toy at that sizehis clothes are quality made but what really makes the doll is the face sculpt its been awhile since ive seen such a faithful adaptation from movie star to dollfigure  but this doll could almost live and breathe it feels so real  the size and proportions are all correct to the star who plays jacob and the hair is even quite well donein all if you know a jacob fan this is perhaps the very best twilight item you can buy them  ive shown it to friends who have literally gasped at the likeness and quality of the doll  and what a display piece considering he can be posed in so many waysthis doll did win one or more awards and when you see it in person youll understand why  highly recommended|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|regardless of what you think of chikorita as a pokemon you cant deny that the little guy is adorable and its about time that we got a good plush of him here in the us as part of the johto region line it was just him and cyndaquil left in the box so of course i picked them up chiko rocks and looks exactly as he does in the stock picturechikorita is a bright green with excellent stitched eyes and mouth he can stand up on his own and isnt overstuffed in any part of his body to throw off the appearance this basically looks like they took chiko out of the game and turned him into a d objects i have zero problems with how he looks even if i did have something bad to say one look at that cute little face would make me feel guilty immediately but the only thing that might bug other people who demand things arrive as shown is that the leaf on its head doesnt stand straight up theres no wire in it so itll be bent back or forward a little most of the time no big deal at all and it looks better with the leaf bent backi really do love this guy and am glad i picked one up i hope jakks continues this quality with the next series so we can finally get a plush miltank|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my  year old daughter for some odd reason doesnt care much for most kids games that i buy her skylanders lego batman and littlebigplanet are the only ones shell play yet when she sees me play something like fallout  street fighter and now bioshock shes all over it she absolutely loved the little sisters and two types of big daddies mainly rosie here of course i bought her the toy recently and she was super excited if you still havent picked one of these up you really should its a fantastic figure that looks great with the other bioshock figures or other toys in general theres just one major flaw with it but its nothing that caution and care cant handlerosie stands at about  inches tall and appears to be slightly taller than the bouncer figure though thats mostly due to his jumbo shrimp posture when assembled this is a bulky figure with the tank on its back giving it a lot of presence on the shelf neca did amazing with the sculpt on rosie making sure every last detail of the design from the game model made it to plastic form the helmet has a nice texture to it the body suit looks properly thick and padded and everything else is deadon i have zero complaints with the appearance of the figure and while most people probably wont pay attention to it because its on the back the tank looks absolutely beautiful paint work is solid all around as well rosies points of articulation are nicely hidden and she sports as much articulation as the elite bouncer shoulders upper arms elbows wrists upper legs knees and feet can all be moved take care when bending some of the joints as they can be very tight and easily broken rosie comes with one accessory the huge rivet gun the gun looks outstanding and fits perfectly into both handsthe major flaw with the figure isnt a big one but its worth mentioning and could save you the hassle of returning the figure after ordering it the two bars over rosies face are very thin mine arrived with one of them broken off and the other was broken on one side a little super glue will fix this easily just be careful with this area of the figure when handling it and rosie should be safe also this figure doesnt have a neat light up feature like the deluxe bouncer has apparently rosie will be getting rereleased in the coming months but its the same version as this one if one with a light up feature comes out thatll be the one to go for but as it is this figure is worth owning either way the last thing i have to mention is that its kinda lame no little sister figure is included with rosie why the heck notim really happy with the bioshock figures weve bought so far sometimes ill have rosie displayed with the gremlins on my shelfother times ill see rosie protecting littlest pet shop pets alongside battle cat|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this set features two barbiescale pets from the fashion fairytale movie  sequin the dog is barbies pet and the cat is her new friend mariealecias  the dogs come with a little play set interchangeable skirts a couple of scarves bone and water dishes  there is surprisingly fun play value since they resemble the movie characters very well and you can put different fashions on them  my  year old plays with the pets more than the mariealecia doll actually  she has them running around the barbie doll from the moviethe dogs are featured pretty prominently in the movie  they even have their own scene together  together with the dog that comes with mariealecia you have the entire set of  characters neatly  since they have their own scene in the movie theres a nice tie in reference that kids can relate to  they definitely have the hautiness of the movie charactersin all for the price i think this is a neat little set  the only concern is that there are a lot of little pieces so it helps if you have a small fashion fairytale bucket holding dolls and dogs in the same place|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|as others have noted it was very disappointing to open the box and find out that this is not a barbie doll so much as a barbie shaped music player  she doesnt bend pose or move  her legs are cheap and hollow from the knee down but above the knee they are connected to one giant music player box  that plays one tune onlythe on button is her belt but that shifts around since it is on her dress  so it can be hard to get it to play at timesyou cant put fashions on herremove her dress which is the most disappointing  what little girl doesnt want to changetake off the dresses of her barbiesthis is in stark contrast to the other singing barbies from previous movies  they all sang by pushing a button in the back or chest and there were no clumsy boxes between the legs  you could easily change dresses or pose them as a result we were expecting more of the same with this barbie but because she isnt like the past ones she doesnt have as much playabilitythe music note she doesnt sing  only plays rock music and lights are the reason to buy the barbie over the nonmusic version  but the compromise on playability just to have lights is just not worth it  mattel could very easily have had the dress light up the way that the kissing pricess and frog dolls dress does|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|there are two versions of this doll  the one on this page and the fancier one with lights and sound from the dvd movie  note that the one with lights and sound has a huge mechanism between the legs which renders the doll unable to sit down and also a big clunky and thick at the thighs  this doll however has the full range of movements of a typical barbie doll  nor will she break or run out of batteriesi think this is an ideal choice for younger children  the older ones  will likely be upsetdisappointed if they didnt get the barbie with the lights and sound however  especially if their school friends have onethis doll is also a good choice if you get the mariealiece doll  that doll barbies friend in the movie is also very vanilla and lacks soundlightsthis doll is decent quality and playable  worth the amount at which she is offered|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we have both of these  the doll comes with two flowers that keep her upright when in water and a windy hair piece to play with her hairto use the doll you wind up the tail fin and then let it go  the motor a rubber band turns the fins  the problem is that the elasticity of the drive means that when you let the fin go after winding it it goes very fast and then stops  i think this would have been much better if the fin always turned at about the same even speed  as it is you spin the tail forever for about half a second of frantic jerky motion of the fins in the water  whether standing upright wont work in a bathrub or swimming under the water neither works smoothly or easily  its just a quick jerk couple of spins and thats it  the motor just spins too fast and the water pressure isnt enough to slow it downthe doll is quite large and doesnt fit into a bathtub well  i think she is far better suited to a poll where she has room to move around  even then she doesnt really swim and my  year old quickly lost interest in winding up the tail only to have it spin wildly for half a second and then peter out  the doll just jerked more than swamthe tail fins are made of thin vinyl type of material and if left into a bent position too long keeps that position permanently  then she no longer swims at allin all weve already lost the two flower pieces the tails are all bent from bathtub play and my  year old long ago stopped trying to wind her up  which makes a big waste of money in having that motor in thre in the first place  she definitely does not live up to the hype of the commercial|ham

A2WS6FMF750EI9|cute idea that just doesnt work moon sand creations crumble at just a light touch due to the fact that creating with moon sand is just like creating with regular beach sand to make great sand sculptures the sand cannot be too fine too damp or too dry even when i gingerly tried to place the molded ice cream sand on top of the molded cone sand disaster would strike and either one or the other or both would crumble enough to create a need for structual or aesthetic repair plus there is no way to adhere the molded ice cream to the molded cone due to the above so there is the possibility that the ice cream will just fall off the cone due to a kid not paying attention maybe spin master will experiment with the size of the sand grains and the moisture ratio in order to create an improved moon sand two pros the molds are sturdy and moon sand is still fun for free playjust foolin around withaddenda two days lateri looked at the directions for moon sand after i wrote the above thinking that i might have missed something about this stuff how hard can it be to use right the directions do indeed state that moon sand should be squished and squashed before use in order to expand and soften the sand this method did seem to somewhat work broad sand sculptures like the ice cream and cone moldings did hold up better although fine tips and edges still did crumble ditto for the molded bananait broke in some way every time the cherry molding was ok the tip fell off if it was handled too much no biggie also want to add here that if you are the type of person that is antimess do not buy this stuff this stuff makes playdoh messes amateur in comparison i have added one overall star to rating because product use improved during my experimentaddenda on  upped the overall stars by one due to my tots enjoymenti have to be fair after all moon sand was purchased for her not for me cleanup is a breeze when product is used outside|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|alright who else stopped dead in their tracks as soon as they saw an elite bouncer for the first time in bioshockraises handthat being said its great that they made a figure of this take on the big daddy as hes a tad bit more menacing than the standard one just look at that harpoon i unfortunately held off on buying the bioshock figures last year when they were easily available because i hadnt played either of the games but here i am just a few weeks after beating it scurrying to get all of them before the prices hike up the elite bouncer here is the first one ive picked up and hes a heck of a figure these may look good in the stock pictures but seeing it for yourself is a whole other story it looks like they used some kind of machine to pull the game model out of bioshock shrink it down and poof you have a figurethe elite bouncer stands at about  inches tall and has some weight to him hes articulated at the shoulders elbows wrists upper legs lower legs and feet surprisingly you can get some really funny poses out of him though hell need to be propped up if you want him to be kept in the pose otherwise a regular standing pose is what hell be stuck in most of the time its understandable though given the design and how the bouncers were in the game theres nothing to be said about the sculpt since its pretty much perfect there have been some complaints about the grill over his head being bent but ive never seen one straight like how it looks in the stock picture it looks like something that just got changed to give the big daddy a more weathered look the tanks on his back are removable and fairly sturdy just dont try twisting the pieces on top of these since they dont turn and could break i dont have any complaints as far as the paint goes either neca has done a pretty poor job in this category for a long time but everything looks good herethings that couldve made this figure better i really wish a little sister had been included it seems like a big miss not having one packed in with the big daddy figures the only other thing to improve would be having the eyes light up like the regular big daddy figure had granted there was a standard bouncer before a lightup feature one was made yet mr elite got nothing oh well these dont hurt the score im giving it mr bubbles in elite form looks fantastic and is a great addition to any toy collection get him while hes still available for a reasonable price|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the misty island thomas movie added quite a few fun toys to the thomas world like the zip and zoom logging adventure a trackmaster setthis set is almost  on amazon and even more at toys r us  i have always thought of the mega bloks sets as something for older children and resisted buying one even though they looked like fun we have wooden trackmasterand take and play thomas sets  your thomas options arewooden set expensive high quality attractive durable and nonmotorizedtrackmaster less expensive motorized plastictake and play smaller doesnt fit on wooden track die cast and plastic a little less expensive than wooden the sets are portable but not extensive good for younger childrenmega bloks can add up to get more than just small pieces of a whole needs construction has flexibility for older children to make and remake setups very small sections are in each set most have a short length of trackwe liked this set because our son likes misty island and because it had both thomas and james and a car  we opened the box and poured out the contents and our  year old excitedly started putting pieces together while we built the basic setup in the instructions  he ended up taking the trains themselves away to play with and seemed to like crashing them off a cliff like diesel in misty island then putting them back togetherit took us  minutes to put together  you really have to pay attention to the little bubbles in the diagrams that show which pieces to connect  once we had it all together we called our son over to play with it  he prefers to manually play with an engine and two cars always two but in this case he put thomas james james tender and the car all together  this track twists and turns there are only two straight sections and they are short one is inside the mountain and its very difficult to get all four of them onto the track correctly while holding it in place so it doesnt slide down  theres no platform where you can really set the trains up then move them like there is on the take and play quarry  so he has to put the trains on the track while slanted and they dont move through the track well manually as he likes  it works better like hot wheels where you start the train at the top and just let it gothis just doesnt fit with what my son likes  the pieces dont stay together well so he just ends up with pieces everywhere that hes too young to put back together  its frustrating for both of us  i just imagine this would be great fun for a  year old who loves putting blocks together and taking them apart and rearranging tracks  maybe in a few years ill find outthough i imagine hell be over thomas by then and hell probably be using legos and not mega bloks|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|giant robo is my second revoltech figure ive bought after gamera where gamera impressed me with how much articulation they were able to give him even with the stout sculpt and design he has giant robo seems like it couldve been a little better dont get me wrong the figure looks great and as a fan of giant robo i can easily say that this is probably the best figure you can get of the iconic character but where gamera was a sturdy figure giant robo is pretty freakin fragile im still on the fence about keeping this guy which is unfortunate because hes such an icon but hey im honest when i review things and dont just gush over the good while overlooking the badfirst the good the sculpt is incredible this looks just like giant robo right down to the belt around his waist the tubelike joints at the knees elbows shoulders and upper legs conceal the revolver joints brilliantly and it makes it so that this figure looks like they just shrank down the giant robo costume and let you pose it on the shelf as usual they snap in place each time you adjust them and the arms hold poses well the paint on my figure was nearly perfect with only a tiny bit of slop on one of the hands aside from their infamous articulation revoltech figures are known for having superb paint and its funny how some companies that put out high end  scale figures for up to three times the cost still have trouble every tiny detail on giant robo is painted accurately to the onscreen counterpart right down to the tiny details like bolts and his signature rocket pack it even has a weathered look to it like hes been through a lot of battles fans will not be disappointed with how it looksthe articulation giant robo has is pretty good you can move the following areas head shoulders elbows wristshands waist upper legs knees and feet all the parts that move on the arms are great though the elbows do look a bit weird when bent as you can see in the stock picture above notice the gap where the revolver joint is its no big deal but just a bit of an eyesore on my part since i have an eye for minor things like that giant robo comes with a grand total of ten hands closed fist grappling missile fingers straight fingers and relaxed all of these make for a bunch of cool poses and itll be hard to get bored posing himuntil it comes to the con which ill get to in a minute his other accessories include the standard name plate a black circle stand orange box to hold the extra hands and a  point revoltech chip which can only be redeemed in japanso whats the big problem theres a few things but the main one is the legs its a real pain to get these things moving around and ive still yet to recreate the poses in the stock pictures where hes doing wide stances there just isnt much mobility here the other problem is something the arms share and its that the limbs come off way too easily right out of the box i thought my robo had one leg longer than the other but i soon found out its just that the limps pop off without much effort this can be frustrating when posing him as youll be readjusting leg length over and over each portion of the leg can be rotated too including the dark parts over the knees and upper legs whats worse the parts that cover the shoulder and hip joints come off and cant be put back into place my robos left shoulder covering is now loose and im always trying to get that thing to stay in place ive seen a lot of videos where people have the same problem but dont mention it for some reasoni feel bad giving him just  out of  stars while he looks perfect and has a great number of extra hands giant robo is just too fragile and im overall just not that happy with the figure if it were a bit cheaper id probably give him  instead fans of giant robo should still pick him up if only to have whats probably going to be the only wellarticulated figure of him but getting some really cool poses is tricky if you can even do it that is sorry giant robo but you deserved better|ham
A2WS6FMF750EI9|we discovered blythe dolls a couple years ago after being exposed to them through gina garans book of blythe photos which i purchased here at amazon they are so sweet but we cannot afford the remake the minis and especially not the kenner originals so these are a higherbeingsend to us anyway i wanted to add my two cents about these lovely sets as soon as possible and try to help clear up certain issues i have read andor skimmed every review on these sets here goes i will agree that the cardboard pic of the wardrobe in the box is misleading but i concluded that it was too good to be true to verify this i looked at pics of all the other sets and determined that it was indeed just a piece of cardboard if you look at the box in person the wardrobe includes about seventeen pieces and some are doublesreally weird that hasbro didnt go all out for the photo the price of this set is not bad at all considering the quality and what you get the stand does indeed work well and is great for showing off the blythes but no kid is going to utilize it during playtime a hand works just as well somebody mentioned that the eyes move in a real mini blythe not correct they only move in the fullsize version the fact that she cannot bend her legs is not earthshattering somehow this makes her more charming snort dont get me started on lost accessories i cannot understand why moms whine about this when ayou know that they are contained in the set you are purchasing and byou can hide them away until a child is deemed fit for accessory responsibility like at age good stuffstrong eyelashescan tilt head in every direction for maximum body language threeyearold has not removed head after repeated exposurecute paintedon underwearshoes stay on very well i experimentedstylish wardrobe and accessoriescan wear rubber polly pocket clothes mini bratz clothes strawberry shortcake clothing even kelly doll clothes in a pinch i experimented againcan fit virtually into every vehicledollhousediy setup present in girls residences she hangs in both our standard dollhouse and barbie vacation houseim sorry did you say something about a mouse oh yeah hes cute but gets ignored while one is basking in the presence of a blythe doll totally heart herattn  these old school blythe dolls can be found at great prices at big lots and at suprisingly toysrus|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|when my threeyearold son noticed that i was rolling dice at one of our tabletop roleplaying game sessions he became obsessed with dice  when i made the mistake of letting him see a recent order of call of cthulhu dice he asked about them for days  it was becoming clear that the boy would need dice of his own  these polyhedral dice came to the rescuewell almost  you get a red d blue d green d yellow d and orange d  youll notice there is no d sixsided  its likely thats because these dice were actually meant as a teaching tool for math purposes and sixsided dice were considered more of the gambling kind of math than the professorinalabcoat kind of math  whatever the case the most common die in the gaming universe is missing from this set yes you can buy foam ds elsewhere but why should have you have tothe dice are indeed made of foam and put up with a lot of abuse but the orange is already beginning to peel on the foursided the other problem is the next most common die after the d the d representing longswords everywhere  all the numbers are detailed in white so white on yellow is very hard to read especially in bright line when theres a bit of a shine on the dicestill theres no beating these dice because  well because there simply are no other dice out there that are comparable  you can buy large ds and ds maybe even a d  forget trying to find a foam d or d but good luck getting them the same size as part of a setas a teaching tool these dice are great  the edges are sharp enough so that theres no partial rolls and the s and s are underlined rather than dots making it easy for youngsters to tell which is which  theyre soft and bounce off siblings heads without creating any bruises and best of all young ones cant easily eat them like regular dice  until my daughter is old enough to stop eating everything in sight these dice will do nicely|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|for fans of the clone wars this is a fun set celebrating one of the best episodes of the show it includes robonino two commando droids and a weequay piratei suspect most people will get this set for robonino the most exotic character of the bunch hes small but packed with articulation and accessories i find that he grips his blaster and detonator pretty well although theyd probably fall out if you move him too much i love the paint job hasbro really captured the bright quirky colorsthe weequay pirate looks great except for the legs  theyre way too long i know the tv show animation style is stylized but the legs on this figure go a bit too far otherwise the face sculpt and paint job are greatone thing that i dont like about the set is that it includes two commando droids i know there were two in the episode but given the variety of other characters from which to choose such as cad bane aurra sing or ig two commandos seems unnecessary however the droids themselves are excellent figures they have all the articulation one could want with balljoint sockets and balance very well on second though maybe its good we got two of themthe set also includes a short dvd featuring clips of some of the bounty hunters its nothing special its only  minutes long and skips over a few key bounty hunters including my favorite dengar however for kids its a cute bonus feature|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i think the version of cad bane with the little robot sidekick is the best version of the character out it comes with more accessories and the face is painted a darker more realistic blue the ig version here is much better than the standalone one he even has articulated fingers and can grasp his gun i love the rusty metallic look|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i stopped collecting star wars back in  and then picked up again in  shaak ti and the geonosian warriors were amongst the last figures i collected back then and the first i got during my rejuvenated collecting the difference is amazing hasbro utilized fabric very well in shaak tis outfit so it isnt too bulky or constraining the geonosian is loaded with articulation which is no mean feat with such narrow limbs he can actually stand on his own now overall these are two excellent figures for fans of atoc|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i dont think this rodian jedi was actually in the geonosis scene in aotc but i absolutely love him this isnt just a rehash of greedo but rather an all new head sculpt the clothes are an appropriate shade of drab and a bit dirty hasbro really took it to the next level in constructing this figurei bought the pack for the rodian but the battle droid is also a great figure even though hes loaded with articulation he stands very well much better construct than the vintage battle droid|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i believe the last time we had a hoth leia was in the potf line this figure is definitely an update with a lot of articulation and beautifully painted clothes the dirt on her outfit looks very appropriate to somebody speeding a lot of time in an underground base my only problem is that the eye pupils are a bit too brown and too large but that might depend upon the actual figure overall this is a wonderful figure|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|usually a good star wars figure is simply one that tries to capture the essence of a character as portrayed in the movies or books occasionally a figure will go beyond that and actually do a better job with the character than the movies themselves this version of dengar is one such figure dengar in empire strikes back seems spaced out and dull by contrast this figure is how i wish dengar was represented the figure has an eerily realistic face with a determined grimace his suit is exquisitely detailed including a backpack and detachable jock strap hes also very articulated although this is almost completely hidden from view and welldisguised in short it reminded me why i loved dengar so much when i first saw him on screen i hope the figure becomes the model for any future portrayals of dengar in the expanded universe or in drawings easily one of the best star wars figures ever|spam

A1M8AYAL3L8ACP|this toy is fun  the things i like along with my kids are the songs themselves and how you can sing along with the mic  its especially nice that you can turn the vocals off so your kids can hear themselves better  we also like the different voices you can choosethe only reason i took off a star is that the cord from the mic should be longer and there should be a way to talk into the mic without any music on but you cant  if the songs arent playing the mic doesnt work  its still a wonderful toy that i recommend though|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|those hoping for a mad men action figure probably wont like this doll  its not meant to carry the likeness of don draper  rather it takes the iconic s male doll from mattel and dresses him as a don draper from mad men  the outfit and accessories are very high quality  top materials that are fully lined and look the part  the body is silkstone  mattels heavier vinyl that has the feel and weight of porcelainmeticulous work went into creating the period clothing and the doll definitely makes an excellent display  yes the younger ken doesnt resemble the more older and wizened don draper  the mad men collection by mattel is meant to take its inspiration from rather than recreate the mad men characters|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this was purchased as a present for my  year old  the concept is really simple you use fabric squares lace and trim pieces are used along with a mannequin to create dresses  the fabric is pushed into strategic rubber teethed openings with a small little tool that comes with the set in the mannequin and skirt form to hold the fabric in place  trim is then added on in the same fashion  the end is a dress that looks like it was sewed  but can be pulled out of the rubber teeth and reused to create many more dress stylesthis kit comes with two skirt silhouettes  a full wide skirt and then a more molded mermaid skirtboth my daughter and i were very surprised at how much she plays with this  we watch project runway together and she feels like she can play along with the designer  or she designs dresses and sells them to me  the set comes with two satins a velvet two lace overlays lace and satin ribbons  quite a variety of looks  we plan to buy more sets|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|hasbros chewbacca sculpt is great and has been getting quite a workout this chewie is my favorite version so far the hair has just the right amount of life to it  not too pulled back as if stuck down with hairspray the paint scheme is a bit more interesting than the other versions of chewie which tend to be a bit too dark also this chewie has his mouth open the pilots gear is cool especially if you seat him in the falcon cockpit but i hope hasbro release this sculpt without the gear as well|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this set has received criticism for basically relying on repaints of older figures i think some of that is fair the chewbacca and star tours officer have almost no articulation and its a shame hasbro used these figures when there are better more recent versions available however the rest of the set is pretty good reeyees is a repaint of the potf figure but it holds up surprisingly well indeed reeyees has always been one of my favorite figures and the repaint and new threeeyed camera only makes it better kaink and teek are all new figures based on their likeness in the ewok movies they have ankle joints but are too small for elbows or knees kaink looks a bit like a generic ewok but teek is a cool little creature in fact this is still the only place to get the teek figure teek has a nearly perfect paint application making him look dirty but cute overall while the individual figures might not be the best but its still a great way to remember the original star tours ride each of these characters really stuck out in the boarding video well except for the generic star tours officer i only wish theyd included a figure of the announcer im looking forward to putting these figures into the fullsize starspeeder  thats coming out later this year|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|a lot of people myself included were disappointed with the first stuffed sackboy came out not too long ago quality control was horrible there were tons of sackboys out there with one arm or leg longer than the other heads were lopsided sackboy was pretty small and it didnt come with any accessorieswhen one of the main features in littlebigplanet was customizing sackboy however you want sure there a few other variations like ones in girl clothes a skeleton one taiko drummer and the suave afro version but you couldnt change outfits with one another and the accessories like the sunglasses were really cheaply made now this newer bigger sackboy plush is out and comes with several shirts you can put on it unfortunately things arent much better this round aside from the sizestanding at  inches tall sackboy looks a little better than he did in his smaller form hes a bit darker than how he appears in the stock picture here and you can move his arms and legs around once again the zipper doesnt work and its plastic instead of metal the shirts that he comes with are all black with grey trim and with a big graphic on them one says yeah in red letters one is a luchador mexican wrestler mask another is a red fist and the last is the lbp tree logo in a pink spray painted circle these easily go on sackboy but dont feel like theyll last very longthat about does it for the good things i can say about sackboy all the problems i had with the original return here the color being too dark is a minor one but the big problem is how cheaply made he is and the lack of any quality control efforts every sackboy ive seen in stores have either had one arm a good inch or two longer than the other a lopsided head from being overstuffed on one side one eye being much higher up than the other etc the material they used to make him is also prone to coming undone and dont be surprised if your sackboy has a couple of loose strands after a few weeks of regular use expect a lot of fuzz balls on him too this is exactly the same as the smaller sackboy just bigger i also dont get why all  shirts he comes with are all the same coloreven with all these problems fans of sackboy probably wont care since hes a popular character that people want merchandise of just realize that depending on the retailer youre going to be spending  times as much as the smaller version for a bigger one with  shirts but the same lack of quality if you manage to find one that doesnt have abnormal limbs or an overstuffed head then youve lucked out and can add a star to my rating i still think the only good stuffed sackboy aside from the numerous ingenious custom ones ive seen around especially the teenage mutant ninja turtle and lion ones is the promotional sackboy given out by media molecule before the first lbp came out|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|you know im not a big fan of the toy story movies and i dont care for woody that much but the second i saw this figure last year with that alternate face it shot up to the top of my most wanted list revoltech figures sell out after a couple of months most of the time but it seems like woody was gone immediately and for obvious reasons did anyone who saw that alternate face not get a bunch of dirty ideas for pictures a few shops managed to get in what seemed to be a second wave of shipments midlast year and once more they were gone in a flash after that if you wanted to get your own woody punseminot intended it was going to cost a pretty penny upwards of a mr benjamin for a little  figure seriously well i didnt think id be saying this but after i managed to finally get one for myself i have to say that its worth the money but im still glad i only paid about half of what hes currently going forif youve never owned a revoltech figure before youre in for a treat revoltech toys are known for their amazing articulation allowing you to put the figure into tons of different poses ive owned gamera and giant robo in the past and was floored by how great the articulation on gamera a stubby and bulky monster turtle was in this scale woody here easily surpasses those figures in the articulation category because of his body type the following areas can be moved head neck shoulders elbows wrists hands torso waist upper legs knees shins and feet all of the joints bend easily and provide endless display options of course the key selling point for this particular toy is the swappable faces with movable eyes both portraits feature little pegs on the back of the eyes that allow you to move them around making woody handsdown one of the creepiest toys ever with that second face moving the eyes can be a little tricky if you move them too far up or over so have some tweezers or something thin and flat ready just in case the little white tool shown in the stock pictures wasnt included with mine and theres no slot for it on the accessory tray either unless you somehow dont care for the second portrait the regular woody face is probably going to be the most neglected accessory herewoody also comes with  extra hands two gripping right hands an open left one and a pointing left one too one of the right hands has a peg in the palm to be used with lenny lenny is the little blue binoculars toy included here as well unfortunately he doesnt have any moving parts despite having the little wind up knob and the feet looking like they can move hes still sculpted nicely and looks great when held theres also a buzz lightyear hand included so woody and buzz can both hold lenny simultaneously the other accessories are a microphone woodys hat and a little black nameplate that most revoltech figures come with and of course woody looks great the sculpting is topnotch with every detail included right down to the pullstring on the back you can also move his hankerchief around and the belt is a separate sculpt when the torso is removed from the legs you can adjust the belt if neededthe only things to watch out for with this toy are the joint pegs dont pull too hard on the hands when swapping them or the face when pulling it off so nothing breaks when i had gamera the pegs on his changeable feet snapped off effortlessly so extra caution is needed fortunately woodys joints and limbs dont seem to be as tight of a fit as gameras so it shouldnt be too much of an issue still once a peg is busted the only option most people will have is gluing it in place ruining articulation on that joint just be careful when posing these figures and everything will be finewhen i placed my order for woody i was on the fence about canceling it but im glad i let it go through this is one of my favorite figures and with the great articulation woody is able to make use ugh bad word choice of many of my other figures get him before the price shoots up again|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|necas teenage mutant ninja turtles figures that came out a few years ago were some of the best toys that came out that whole year they looked like they stepped right out of the old comics articulation was better than some high end figures and they were priced perfectly and now we have head knockers of the turtles from neca as well ill admit while i never liked leonardo his pose looked the best to me but i went and ordered donatello since hes my favoriteeven if he has the most awkward pose i liked what i saw in the picture though as far as the paint and sculpt goes since it looks like don matches the smaller figure unfortunately the figure is  times better than this head knocker but its still cool in its own rightfirst up the little black lines here and there on the body that the figure had are here too and thats something i love about this head knocker it looks like a drawing the most detailed thing on donatello is the bandanna with the wrinkles and how it flows just right dons base looks like part of a roof and the sculpt on this is very good as well hes got his trademark bo resting on his wrists with his hands behind it its the kind of thing youll see someone who uses a bo in martial arts do when theyre just messing around being boredyeah i didnt exactly have a lot of pros to talk about there did i i gotta go with the pose as being my main con here why do the other three even michelangelo have much better poses than poor don he couldve been holding his bo in a defensive position out in front of him blocking or doing a low sweep attack anything wouldve been better than this it looks even stranger in person when youre looking right at it the paint on my donatello was pretty average for neca some slop here and there on the face how they managed to screw up the whites of his eyes is beyond me but the base was downright inexcusable its a little taller than what you see in the picture and the bricks are of course grey and red two simple colors and theres literally splatters of paint all over it im torn on trying to decide if its worse than my nightmare before christmas mayors water spotted jacket or not but of course the base isnt the part people notice when they check out the collection so i cant be too mad though it definitely shouldnt have passed quality control that is if neca even has such a thing finally my donatello arrived broken ive read that this is a common problem with all the turtles as the bandannas ends are thin and the most fragile thing about them i was able to fix it easily with glue but this thing could easily break into a bunch of smaller pieces and not be so easily fixable for others if you have a store that carries these and can gently shake the box to hear for any rattling sounds you might want to do that over ordering one just so it doesnt end up broken when handled on the planetruck during shipping also the bobble feature isnt that great since the spring is a shorter one than ive seen on other head knockers and donatellos head vibrates rather than wobbles for a second before going back to normal weirddonatello couldve been better and i really wanted to like this when i ordered it even with how dumb the pose is but the sloppy paint and fragile bandanna part keep this from getting a higher rating id give it a  if i could but rounded down the score i might order leonardo in hopes that he ends up better than this at least he has a rockin pose|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i was intrigued by this dollhouse by the fact that it wasnt plastic  i wanted something a little more upscale looking and like a display piece when not used  because honestly this is huge to fit the barbie doll size scale  it will take up a good chunk of room and should at least not look like a giant plastic eyesore when not in use  i have nothing against plastic  but bedrooms and living rooms are made up of wood furniture not plastic  so it matches much better without that shiney plastic look  it looks solid and like a wood construction itemputting it together does take a lot of time  if you are using this for christmas give yourself  hours  keep in mind that it is made of mdf  sawdust glued together tightly  so it isnt true wood  but that isnt obvious due to the beautiful painting job and the mdf does make it very heavythe furniture is sized for the house not the dolls  this means that they are a bit small for barbie dolls  they look good in the house but barbie is going to look like an amazon among midget furniturei feel the playvalue of this is very good  the working elevator gives girls something to move and activate with the house and my  year old uses it a lot  and she uses it as an alternative to the plastic barbie castles from the barbie dvds  shell take out one dvd doll set and play and then the next day enact scenes from a different barbie dvd  it works out well for multiple purposesin all id much rather have this than the plastic doll houses out there now  it is bright colorful and provides very good play value  in addition it makes a nice display when not in use in playrooms or bedrooms|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|great first set for a budding pez collector my daughter insisted on opening her set audible gasp from me and the pez goddess so i know that the little tin lunchbox is durable due to many openings and closings comes with four tough pez dispensers and a boatload of fresh pez candy there is a pic on the back of the box of hk sorta peeking from the bottom right corner with a little mouse waving hi from the top of hks head behind them a rainbow cheers the spirit along with diagonal light pink pinstripes that well just add more pink to the whole pinkdrenched theme candy is made in the usa and is nut and gluten free my daughter got her set at target for just under  in the seasonal valentines day aisle just a few weeks ago so hurry note although one might feel that a child cannot learn much from pez dispensers i belive that they can get a little history lesson and even a geography quiz from owning these beauties go to wikipedia and the pez site to get cool facts|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|bruder has built a name in europe specifically germany for realistically detailed toys that are highly articulated lots of working moving parts for more play fun bruder is a company that is one hundred years old and theres a good reason it has survived this long its toys really are the best you can buy they are not cheap knockoffs all vehicles are highly detailed based on actual vehicles and built using the latest in computer equipment  they are meant to be played with  to give kids a sense of being able to play with the real vehicle only smaller  scalebruder trucks are made of abs plastic  an extremely high quality and durable material why abs plastic instead of metal  the abs allows these large vehicles to be lighter more flexible have more details to withstand weather better no rust and to hold true colors for a lifetime wont chip off  abs is a toddler safe plastic  highly durable and able to withstand use and abuse  at the immense size of these trucks they would be unusable if made of any kind of durable metal aluminum would not be durable enoughthe first thing youll notice when you take it out of the package is that bruder trucks come with rubber wheels  they roll and move easily indoors and out it adds to that feeling of quality and really makes the vehicles feel realthis set comes with two vehiclesthe cat excavator modeled from the cat c l large hydraulic excavator manufactured by caterpillar inc has a control handle that allows you to control the digging scoop and rotate the cab it also has working realistic plastic linked tracks the wheels on the excavator move cleanly on the treads and it swings freelythe mercedes benz actros the amazon product description has a typo in it was modeled after the actual heavy duty transportation vehicle first introduced in  it has a tipping drivers cab so that the engine can be seen and inspected by your child the mirror of the cab folds out the low loading for the excavator trailer has a th wheel clutch that works as well as folding legs support so it doesnt tip over while loading the excavator just like the real truck those folding legs tuck into the locking device for securing the excavator onto the truck the track loader has a real working mast and shovel that can be moved or detached and theres a ripper that moves in the back finally the doors to the cab open and close and i found our  year old putting various figures inside  there is a lot to do on this truck and i really appreciate the detail that went into not only the presentation of the real truck but also usabilityi think if you have kids who like to destroy things or if you would rather buy one high quality durable and highly detailedrealistic item for your kids rather than a bunch of cheap dispensible little items then this is truly an excellent and one of a kind purchase  and it makes sense to spend your money on one good item rather than wasting it on a bunch of little things that easily bore kids or that get broken easily  this will last through several kids and even have a resale value beyond thatwith toys getting cheaper in quality and having only limited shelf or tv commercial appeal its good to come back to toys made to be used and enjoyed for several years in a childs lifethis set is used by my very active  year old and he has no problems with the controls and really looks forward to coming home everyday and playing with his toy  ive had it in the sand box outdoors and also indoors  it works well on hard wood floors or carpeting  the big rubber wheels do the job  it looks like it will be a toy he will enjoy for a long time|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|neca has had some problems with its alien figure line but it seems to have resolved all of those with this figure this figure has excellent articulation the detailing of the sculpt is beautiful especially in low lighting he really looks like a monster i definitely applaud necas decision to give this alien a stand which helps him keep his pose the one drawback to the figure is that hes missing ankle articulation which limits your ability to pose him overall you can buy this figure with confidence|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|as far as clone trooper figures go this is definitely the best out there it has all the amazing articulation points fans expect from the vintage line the armor looks nice and shiny theres so much thats good about this figure yet i feel compelled to give it a  rating because a few minor tweaks would have made it the perfect clone trooper first the shoulder pads the joints for the figures shoulder articulation are clearly visible and distracting i cant imagine why hasbro did this especially as it did such a good job with commander cody at hiding those shoulder joints second the helmet looks like its made of cheaper or at least not as shiny material i might be overly critical but i just feel neither of these shortcomings would have been particularly difficult to address still if you get any clone trooper make sure its this one|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily the best version of darth sidious out there although there are probably better emperor palpatine figures the detail on the face is amazing this looks more realistic than the awful makeup in episode iii the sunken eyes and yelling mouth look particularly evil its easy to see the resemblance between this version of darth sidious and palpatine as we see him in episode vi moreover the soft goods are very well done and cover the entire figure i think the robes probably should have been a bit looser because as it is sidious looks a bit too thin also the blue sith lightning doesnt stay on his hand easily i gave it to darth bane instead overall this is a great figure for fans of episode iii or any of the sith figures|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|id read the complaints about quality control in neca and problems with some of these predator figures despite that i bought the figure and was generally pleasedfirst the likeness is incredible neca incorporated wonderful detail painting the predators skin pattern and netting on his legs moreover the figure is posable and has a great sense of balance generally this predator has all the articulation you could ask for including the all important wrist and anklesthats not to say my figure didnt come with any flaws the left side of the head tails wasnt well glued to the head two of the necklace strings were not well glued to the bone necklaces and the left hand peg stuck out a bit too far fortunately the first two i resolved pretty quickly with crazy glue for the second i pushed the peg a bit deeper into the arm and now the hand fits perfectly as much as i would have liked the figure to come out of the box perfectly none of these flaws were fatal|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i collect bobbleheads but i tend to go for ones made of resin over plastic or vinyl im not one of those collectors who thinks that the weight of something makes it more valuable but in my experience the ones that are plastic look a little boring at times because of how the paint looks on them but when i saw this set of  bumbles they sure didnt look boring come on bumble was already a great character design and all but getting  different colored versions of him in one box thats just plain cool these are my first bobbleheads from funko and they didnt disappoint me at all maybe ill be giving funko some of my money as the years go by if the rest of their bobbleheads are as good as thesehere youre getting a yellow pink and teal bumble in one package its limited to  pieces and was a san diego comic con exclusive in  all three are from the same sculpt and the only difference is obviously the color while all  look great and the colors pop out at you when you look at them i have to say that the pink is my favorite with the blue a close second the yellows great too but the colors on the other two are just a tad more vibrant bumble has a great big smile on his face and you can even move the arms up and down which is new to me since none of my other bobbleheads have articulation they dont have bases but stand on their own two feet and the bobble feature works great i actually like the sound the head makes when it clanks around the shoulders it has a nice hollow sound that i dont get from my resin ones and since these guys are vinyl theyre much more durable and safer from breaking than say necas head knockers really the only thing to watch out for with these wacky wobblers is making sure no one twists the heads too much which could lead to the spring breakingfor anyone who likes to keep their toys in boxes the box for these is very flimsy when i opened the top flap it ripped both sides of the box immediately and i was being careful too its made of a very thin cardboard and even a shoe box is more durable than this thing just something to keep in mind if you display your toys nrfb or if you just like to have the box set aside somewhere because you like the art or know you might resellwhile this set runs a little high when alls said and done and ill admit that after i ordered a set i was worried about having spent too muchthese guys put a smile on my face and made my day when i opened the box fans of rudolph should definitely have these in their home if only because of how unique they are and bobblehead collectors who need some christmas representation look no further than this set but you better hurry before these are gone for good|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|orko was always one of my favorite heman characters and the original figure of him was one of my favorites back in the s now that ive recently gotten into the motu classics line i had to track down the little magician to properly start my collection unfortunately he rarely goes up for sale through the official matty site so you have to be quick to snag one for yourself i was lucky enough to do so a few weeks ago and while they messed up big time in overcharging me i bit the bullet and kept orko finally opening him not too long ago i have to say that he looks much better inperson than he does in pictures orko is such a little figure but the sculpt is fantastic and even the floating stand he comes with doesnt look too bad and of course he comes with probably the best accessory of all the figures so farstanding at less than  inches tall the little magician is by far the smallest figure released in the motu classics series because of his size and shape the articulation is limited but whats here is very good you can move his head around and even remove it if you want to the scarf thingy he has over his mouth can be moved around as well he has articulated shoulders elbows and wrists too his hat isnt removable like the old figure from the s but i guess you cant win em all theres a common problem with this figure where the orange from his hat bleeds onto the ears some figures have it bad while others are ok this was supposed to be corrected after the first wave but apparently thats not the case aside from that theres nothing bad to say about the paint or sculpt orko looks how he should and manages to fit in with all the others from motu classicshis accessories include a magic wand a spell book and a clear stand thats supposed to make him look like hes floating the wand is easily held in his right hand and the spell book can be held in his left but it takes a bit of adjusting and even then its a loose fit no extra hands or head sculpt are included the stand works well and since it goes about halfway into orko balance isnt much of a problem you can even tilt him in different directions on the stand allowing for some fun poses i do wish the base on the stand were a little bigger or heavier just to ensure that he doesnt fall over if someone runs by or bumps into the shelf hes on causing him to tumble down oh and did i mention that he comes with a whole extra figure for an accessory prince adam himself is thrown into the bottom of the packaging and comes with one full sword one halfsword and an additional teethshowing head sculpt yep we finally get heman in his stylin purple pants with the furry undies this figure is great and has the usual articulation youd find on practically any other male character in this line one problem though is quality control and i got the short end of the stick on mine my adams right foot is incorrectly installed and he has to have it positioned kind of sideways in order to stand up with the purple pants and purple swords it doesnt exactly make him look masculine when standing like thisorko is an absolute must for collectors i highly recommend getting this normal version over the vanishing one from sdcc that ones good and all but having the normal version fits in with the others much better as much as i want to be mad at this toy for costing me so much thanks to mattys brilliantly poor customer service and policies i cant help but smile whenever im posing him or when i see that my daughter had him playing with her toys when i get home from work get him when you can but dont pay the inflated prices hell be available again sometime|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i admit i havent read the kotor comics associated with these figures however i got them because they look like a mix between star wars and lord of the rings fortunately my whim did not lead me astray these are both great figuresrohlan dyre is a mandalorian deserter and has the awesome armor to prove it he comes with a jetpack helmet blaster and knife the weapons fit nicely into his holsters the jetpack has a cable that you can attach to his helmet im not sure why its needed i guess a line to an oxygen tank but it looks cool dyres face is also quite realistic with scars and bruises dyre has most of the articulation one would expect from a modern star wars figure but i still cant seem to find a pose for him other than standing erect overall the figure looks like something out ofrocketman but with star wars technologyjarael is well gorgeous shes easily the first star wars figure that captures a female characters beauty and femininity  without scant clothing her paint is very well done especially the dark blue tattoos great articulation and the joints dont stick out even the neck joint is well concealed under her hair she comes with a light staff which is a nice change of weapon from the usual lightsaber and a purse an equally dangerous weapon the cloth skirt flows well but id recommend not undoing the cloth when taking it out of the package the back piece looks better slightly pushed behind her legs rather than covering her completely and this is how she looks in the picturesthis set should be a particular treat for kotor fans dyre and jarael not only lived around the same time as revan and malak but also interacted with them jarael was malaks love interest for a while i can see why dyre supported the revanchist jedi against his former mandolorain colleagues if youre a fan of the games this is like an expansion pack with more characters|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|mattel had some problems with the previous ghostbusters figures in the  inch scale rays head size was ridiculous peter had paint issues and egons glasses were just a tad too thick so we were down to winston wondering what theyd screw up on since he looked perfect in the prototype pictures but the final products are almost always different low and behold winston is the best one the figure looks exactly as it does in stock pictures and the head sculpt is perfect if you havent gotten a  inch ghostbusters figure yet you gotta get winston if only so youre not disappointed with the qualityif you own any of the previous figures winston is essentially the same as far as the outfit and accessories go he comes with the standard jumpsuit with all the pockets zipper pulls and everything as well as the zeddemore and no ghosts logo patches these seem like theyre ironon transfers so be careful adjusting the outfit in the areas where they are the proton pack looks fantastic and you couldnt ask for much more attention to detail on it unless you wanted it made of metal like in the movie theres a button on the bottom of the pack that activates  red leds when pressed and the lights go in a clockwise formation for a few seconds its really cool the wandgun looks great too though you might have trouble getting it into the hands because of how thick the handle is regardless the outfit and accessories are all great and for the original price this figure went for its a steal considering some other companies coughsideshowandmedicomcough charge much more for similar products with the quality being so hows the head and body well the head sculpt is perfect and theres no denying that its ernie hudson unfortunately the paint on the face is a bit washed out my winstons eyebrows were a bit light and even a bit crooked and the whites in the eyes had some brown paint dabs here and there still its not like i was expecting a hot toys quality figure and im happy with what i got for my money the bodys wellarticulated too with articulation in the neck shoulders chest abdomen elbows wrists waist hips knees and ankles winstons accessories include a set of ungloved hands with articulation in them so you can bend them forward and back a ghost trap that opens when you press a red button on it two copies of the building blueprints these are printed on standard paper the standard walkie talkie and a newspaper plastic that features the ad for the job when he went in for his interview hes setaside from the slightly sloppy job on the paint i only have a few minor complaints first is the packaging he comes in i love the locker for his accessories and it slides out easily but the rest of the packaging is a nightmare getting close to opening the box only to find out theres even more tape in other areas was frustrating and chances are that youll be destroying a small part of it during the opening process the other thing is the zipper pulls on his uniform are just sewn on there arent any actual zippers again this isnt a hot toys figure so we cant expect whats basically a real outfit shrunk down but some collectors might be irkedif you havent gotten winston yet you better hurry before he goes for insane prices like egon and ray do now but there is a ghostbusters  version set for february its a two pack with peter and im sure theyll both be similar to these first movie figures just with different outfits and accessories either way you need winston|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|these two figures are from the infamous deleted scene instar wars episode iv  a new hope    versions disc widescreen edition in the scene fixer and camie tease luke about dreaming about space battles as such this is a pretty neat pair of figures for collectors fixer is well done although he has trouble holding his blaster in his left hand camie is ok not as exciting and her neck looks a bit too thin part of the problem is that the ball allowing her to rotate her head isnt well hidden if you make her look down and look at her from above the figure looks pretty good again these are not figures youll ever play with and maybe not even use for dioramas  although theyd be great for a tatooine homestead diorama  but probably will rest in the display case|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|fans of juno will recognize quite a few of these songs and this orchestral edition does them justice  particular favorites include rhythm is everywhere broccoli ill cut my hair and cool cat if youve never watched juno the song titles wont make a lot of sense  but that shouldnt harm your or your kids enjoyment of the music broccoli and rhythm is everywhere are particularly catchyalthough the broccoli song seems to do the exact opposite of its intent by becoming a rallying cry not to taste broccoli that said its a very different thing to hear these songs than see them on screen much of junos charm is puppetry and cgi and although my son loves the dvds he has no interest in the cdsalso the cat characters voice is really irritating|ham
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|my three year old son first became acquainted with the juno baby videos on youtube so when i saw an opportunity to review a juno dvd i jumped at the chance  juno jr a slightly more advanced version follows the adventures of young juno a little girl with dark pigtails and her baby brother rai rai in a diaper and capethe show begins with juno and rai rai in their bedroom portrayed as puppets with her pet cat bunny and a caterpillar in a jar the three pets are real but when juno and rai rai climb aboard an imaginary train to harmonia springs cat bunny and caterpillar transform into puppets toojuno and rai rai are the protagonists serving as proxies for the children watching the show  cat is polite unlike any cat i know caterpillar is the brainy one and bunny is the crazy one who does rash things like press the giant red button that says do not press on caterpillars shush machine it seems caterpillar really wanted some peace and quiet in front of the library but like every mad scientist his device eventually turns against him  harmonia springs goes silentour motley crew then goes on a quest to restore music to the springs by searching out melody tweeting birds rhythm the sound of the train and harmony musical frogs  the juno series makes a point of explaining how music works and reinforcing that music is all around us and this episode stays true to form  throughout theres some colorful but simple computer graphics segments that encourage children to interact by answering questions or dancing and of course a beautiful musical scoreif theres a criticism of the show its that it skews slightly female as juno is the protagonist and there are more girls than boys shown dancing during the interactive segments  thats a minor quibble in an otherwise excellent product for teaching children about music  my boy watched this three times in two days including the extras|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|we already have the juno dvd and this is a nice complement to the piece rhythm is everywhere is familiar to fans but a few of them are unique to the dvd  all of this makes for a pleasant modern form of classical music thats a great transition into more complex pieces  still start with the dvd first so kids can make the connection|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|of all the godzilla rival monsters i think mothra still stands out the most to me godzillas faced dozens of weird creatures like giant turtles that spin random sea monsters a huge gorilla a robot version of himherself a threeheaded dragonbut one of them was a giant moth and mothra did a pretty damn good job of roughing up godzilla too if you havent seen their famous fight yet mothra has now been immortalized in another vinyl figure this one being one of the most popular so far the rainbow mothra it looks a lot more appealing than the bland colored ones out there not that it makes those any less cool but this one sure caught my daughters attention in the toy store a few months ago and after showing her clips from mothra and godzillas fight mothra is now one of her many favorite monstersthe figure looks perfect for something more in the toy or lowend collectible market the sculpting is great and i dont have any complaints about it at all they did a fantastic job giving mothra that furry look on its body and the textures on the eyes wings and legs is really cool the wings are fairly thick but hollow so theyre kind of squishy if you squeeze them but theyre still very durable mothra has limited articulation mostly because of the fact that its a moth and theres only so much you can do for it the front legs can be moved up and down the head moves around and the wings can kind of flap when you move them the colors on the wings pop out way more inperson than they do in the stock picture and the rest of mothras painted nicely there isnt any action or talking feature here which is kind of a downer but for the price its all good compared to godzilla and other figures in this line mothra is pretty much inscale so of course there will be some complaints about how small the toy is on its own though mothras a good size again the standard price of these figures isnt very high at all just barely more than what a wimpy   star wars figure costs these days so for your money you could do a lot worseunfortunately like many toys on here vendors are raising the price quite a bit dont pay more than you should for this and youll be fine the only other mothra figure ive seen in recent years thats as good or better than this is the revoltech one but its about  times what i paid for this so if youre a casual godzilla fan or just getting this for one of your kids this rainbow mothra is a great buy|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i hadnt heard of these teacup piggies until earlier this week when a commercial was on and my daughter pointed out that she had to have one as it turned out she had more than enough money in her piggy bank for one so she picked out snowflake here at the toy store i wont deny it these are some of the cutest toys ive seen in a while probably since the furby era at the same time the ideas just so weird little pigs that sit in teacupsand you dress them up still my daughter loves this thing and i can see it being one of the hotter toys this year easily becoming this years zhu zhu pettickle me elmofurbyrobosapienthe teacup piggy is just a cute plastic pig with fuzzy skin you can move the head and legs around a little bit but theyre pretty stiff theres a switch on the bottom that goes from demo off and on snowflake says a bunch of different things when you move her around or press her nose and even when you dont do anything which could be a problem for parents with little patience and for those who hate buying batteries all the time snowflakes a cheerleader pig oh the irony and says some cheerleadery things here and there she even says lol she comes with a little bow sunglasses and the teacup to set her in though she stands up perfectly without it accessory packs are sold separately but add some more play value to the toy a lot like the accessory packs for zhu zhu petsso why the  and  stars in the ratings first the durability i was very very surprised when i picked snowflake up and felt how thin the plastic is if anyone accidentally steps on one of these pigs theyre toast fortunately the price isnt anywhere near as much as it couldve been for something like this so you wont feel like its a huge blow to your wallet whenif you have to get a replacement the fuzzy coat on the pig is also pretty cheap and i noticed that snowflakes right ear was missing a bit on the tip right out of the package there are also some weird indentations around the chin that dont look like anything the plastic bubble caused its also worth mentioning that the fuzzy skin gets dirty easily since shes a lighter color bits of fuzz from clothing and carpet will go straight to poor snowflake in no time also the person who they got for snowflakes voice sounds kind of bored i wouldve went with a more enthusiastic person to do the voice especially for a cheerleader character but its something i doubt any kids will care about when playing with the toy theres not much in the way of education other than your kid learning a little songbut overall i really dig these pigs my daughters almost  and picked this over several other things that shes really into or wanted for a longer time and she even had snowflake on her pillow when she was sleeping if you or your kids are interested in these teacup piggies at all you might want to hurry and get one or two now before it gets harder to find them in the next  months but at the same time i see on the companys site that they already have  more waves on the way so it looks like therell be plenty to choose from|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the really nice thing about the lego keychains is that they actually stay on the ring and dont fall off easily  ive had some on my key chain for over a year now with no problemthe clone pilot comes with a brightly painted helmet that has a separate head glued inside more detail  the head is fully posable  the painted detail on the front and back of the chest is quite exception and intricate  very impressive attention to the details with this key chain  because the arms and legs are movable you can have fun posing him the legs move independently which is nice  even the wrists move so you can move around the handsits a great little keychain and a fun toy to boot|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the second i saw the classic ostrich in vinylmation form i had to have it and promptly bought one of the have a laugh boxes it ended up being pluto inside which was fine since he was my second choice still i was ostrichless and decided to cheat and buy the figure from an auction site man do i love this thing while i do like a lot of the vinylmation designs a lot of them do look a bit bland and there are very few that stand out from the rest this thing sure as heck stands out and im surprised he isnt very popularthe ostrich is nearly a full head taller than the other regular sized vinylmation figures thanks to the neck piece which you can remove if you want when you open the foil and get the ostrich it comes with the neck joint separately packed obviously they do it this way so there arent random boxes that are taller than the others easily revealing whos inside to get the neck piece on you simply pop off the head snap on the neck joint then pop the head on that piece and youre set the neck can be rotated separately from the head and body too though theres no real point in doing so since the design is the same all around the ostrich sports an angry look on its face and has its egg down at its feet also the mickey ears are clear something more vinylmation figures should have if theres nothing else needed above the head as usual it also comes with a little card of the figurefans of the old cartoon featuring this wacked out bird should definitely pick one up the only thing to be careful with is the arms as theyre flimsy on all vinylmation figures in this size but it doesnt affect the overall score heres hoping that future vinylmation figures are more unique like this one|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|the twlight jane doll is quite lovely and as with all barbie collector dolls comes with stand and certificate of authenticitysome things to note  she is not posable  the legs and arms are hard hollow cheap plastic and do not bend or move in any way  janes going to be posed the same way always  her body is also hollow hard plastic plastic that feels very cheap like a dimestory barbie knock off  its surprising the lack of quality in a barbie collector dolljane is probably best displayed on a shelf or left in her box i wouldnt recommend her for younger kids who want to play with her  likely theyd break a hollow leg easily she clearly is not of the same quality as the previous twilight barbie dolls which is a shame|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i bought ellie mae at the same time as the i dream of jeannie doll  i ended up liking the jeannie doll much moreellie maes hair is not stylable or brushable  it is practically glued into place into stiff and unmoveable gobs  even the twirls at the back are hard and unmoveable  shes clearly meant to be a statue and not a dollanother detail im not as happy about is the shirt  the faux buttons on top hide two snaps underneat  and those snaps are placed one above the bust and one at the pants line  that leaves a gaping hole under the  fake buttons  the snaps also bulge out from under the shirt  making an unattractive ddisplaythe rest of the details of the outfit are fine and she comes with a slingshot  in all if choosing to buy only one or two of the retro s tv character dolls this might be the last one you would chose  jeannie and bewitched look better|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this ken collector fashion doll has a wonderful interpretation of classical japanese fashion  note that the windows peak on his forehead is painted on but it does make the doll more interesting  he comes with a sword for display purposes and his hair is long and unbound in the back  in all it is quite a striking doll and makes an excellent display  im very pleased with this purchase|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|as others have noted this ken doll is quite fun  you can play back whatever you record in several types of voices  it really makes my  year old laugh to hear her voice deep like a mansthe only detraction for me is that he has solid legs so he isnt that posable other than bending at the waist  his clothes are nearly identical to the shaving fun ken doll and his hair is nearly solid from the gel  you cant style itbut in all a fun doll with a lot of play value|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|what a mess  on the second day my  year old was playing with this doll it snapped in half  what we didnt realize is that the bust is attached to the waist with a small plastic rod to make the transformation happen  she doesnt have any poseability and my daughter didnt realize that she bent the doll over to sit her and snap  there was a sharp broken plastic piece exposed on both ends the doll has hollow hard plastic cheap legs so the only way to make her sit was to bend her at the waist just like the other barbies  except you find out the hard way that she cant bend sit or even posemore disturbing was the sharp plastic pieces on each end of the broken area  that cant be safe  we made sure to look for any pieces that might have flown off when it snapped as well in case her  year old cousin visitedeven before it broke however we could tell it suffers from the same problem that mariposa and a lot of the other transforming fairy dolls had the wings do not stay on nor will they stay up  i wish we had bought the less expensive non transforming version insteadeverything about the doll feels cheap the legs are cheap hollow plastic not softer vinyl the dress works oddly if at all she doesnt have undergarments so when she bends over she bares all the face and hair are very generic looking barbie actually reminiscent of the cheaper  line of dolls and her chestbody is very square and oddly shaped  that doesnt even take into account that the wings just fall off all the time even our winx dolls have wings that dont fall off  whats the point of a fairy doll if the wings dont stay on everfinally the whole transforming thing is a joke  you pull strings in the back that hang down below the length of the doll when not in use to pull up the dress so it goes from ankle length to fairy length short  but the strings only pull up one inner skirt and not the outer oneneither my daughter nor i can push the small sharp edged butterfly button on the wings to make those raise up and when they do only one goes up limply and the other goes half way and falters  even if the wings stayed on we couldnt get them to workin all an incredibly bad dolls in every regard  get the nontransforming version of this doll and save yourself the disappointment|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|there have been a few versions of the tie bomber but this is definitely the one to get the original version was pretty good this one just adds a few tweaks as the other reviewer noted the bombs are blue instead of red and theres a frontfiring missile the cockpit has been totally redesigned and looks great for me the best thing i can say about this vehicle is that the wings are nice and sturdy i remember the old potf tie vehicles always felt like their wings were going to snap off i have no such qualms with this one definitely a good ship to get for your collection|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i have mixed feelings about this figure one the one hand its a beautifully sculpted and painted figure he comes with two axes and a staff his helmet also comes off showing his bald head one blog named this the figure of the year and in terms of quality its hard to disagree on the other hand the skirt is puffy making the gamorrean a bit of a fuzzball the previous version of the figurestar wars otc gamorrean guard with the plastic skirt actually looks a bit more like the guards instar wars episode vi  return of the jedi    versions disc widescreen edition this certainly isnt enough to take a star off in fact this version of the gamorrean is even better looking than the one in the movie id just recommend combing the skirt down or even using water so it stays down another option is to twist the skirt around because the back part of the skirt is shorter than the front doing this actually works really well|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i had mixed feelings about getting this figure but am definitely glad i did its  perfect the face sculpt is spot on and the this figures got all the articulation you could want my only complaint is about the wrist joints  they allow for a greater range of motion but theyre a bit too big fortunately this isnt a deal breaker in fact the wrist joints look a lot smaller in person than in many pictures and it really only sticks out on lukes natural hand you cant notice it on the gloved hand still if thats whats preventing you from getting this figure my advice is to not worry about it once you pose luke with his lightsaber preferably gripping it with his natural hand on the bottom to hide the wrist a bit more youll never notice|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive been on a roll collecting the bioshock figures over the last month or so and managed to snag a subject omega gift pack on clearance the other day last store in the state that had this thing i was pleasantly surprised at how nice omega and the little sister looked and even though hes just a repaint of delta when it comes down to it i like him a little more than subject delta the little sister thats included is again a repaint of the other little sister figure but this one comes with a unique accessory the obvious selling point of this gift pack is the bunny splicer mask there was a big deal about many of these being damaged during shipping with the ear thats supposed to be intact breaking off easily mine is just fine so its not a problem for me but it is something to consider when ordering this set online if possible email the seller and see if they can make sure its ok before sending it out and make sure its packed securelysubject omega is the exact same figure as subject delta except with different colors and he comes with a giant gun instead of the drill arm the paint on this guy looks great and he stands out from the other bioshock figures because of it he even has the appropriate symbols on his hands something that was missing on the delta figure the slightly brighter color scheme pops out when hes with the other big daddies omega has articulation in the shoulders elbows wrists waist upper legs knees and feet the gun can be held in his right hand without any problems and it looks better inperson than it does in the stock picture above once again just like delta youll have to attach the tank on his back as well as the tubes but this only takes a few seconds this is a very sturdy figure that shouldnt have any trouble standing up on its own over time and theres very little at risk of breaking here the one thing to watch out for is the knife on omegas left hip it doesnt come out of the sheath so dont pull on it too hard as it could break off of the legthe little sister is perfectly inscale with omega as well as the other bioshock figures she has a good amount of articulation headneck shoulders elbows and knees just the right amount and not too much so she wont be doing insane poses the paint on this figure is very good too and i like that they gave her a red dress instead of simply repackaging the other little sister figure she comes with her good ol syringe which can be held in either hand and a subject delta doll that can be held with a little work or you can give it to delta or omega to holdfinally theres the splicer mask made of resin the mask sculpt looks just right and should fit most people the elastic strap on the back goes down diagonally so just be careful when adjusting it so it doesnt slip off all of a sudden im actually a little disappointed with the paint work on the mask it looks rushed and like the weathering was randomly done still it looks good when worn and is the key piece for any splicer costume if youre going for the look just use extreme caution when removing it from the plastic tray theres a small tab that holds the full ear down and since resin is a much more fragile material than most people give it credit for you could easily snap the ear in half when trying to take it outas long as you can get a good deal i highly recommend getting this set the paint on the mask may be lacking but its a heck of a lot better than the welder mask that came out seriously why bother making that thing its just weird that the one big daddy figure that does come with a little sister is the one that was exclusive to a certain store and came with another bonus|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|i chose to review this set as opposed to the others because this set had the most current packagingi can review only half of this set the yellow cake mix it was just ok i could detect an anise flavoring in there thats about it i will never review the devils food cake mix because i am thrifty and refuse to spend money on a kids cake mix that can possibly end up tasting like dog food after baking in my defense i was trying to be politely informative to the public at large by stating that this is the most current packaging for the easy bake mixes thus easy bake products with the cursive script are the most current and therefore the freshest i could not review the yellow cake mix that is packaged alone here on amazon because the packaging of that particular one is older with different script could be an entirely different recipecontain different ingredients and was not the one that i purchased these products with the current ohsotrendy cursive script were the ones that i saw in toysrus in november  i also saw at the same store the easy bake mixes with the former simple kiddish script iethe old version and swiftly concluded that those products were less than fresh so basically i wish to clarify that i tried to make the wisest purchasing decision and we did purchase and try the yellow cake mix with the most current packaging and yes it was nuthin to write home about now if half of this set was just ok and not spectacular would you want to take a pricey roll of the dice and then find out that the chocolate half was indeed terrible and with the odds against you let me tell ya these mixes are not exactly stellar i am taking way one overall star so that i do not cause general confusion in the area of whether or not i endorse these mixes i do not and maybe the readers who voted my review as unhelpful are easy bake mixes zealots or they thought i was lame for only reviewing one half of a product jeez i thought i was helpingfootnotes  i do not know if the packaging has changed since november  five stars for fun due to general baking excitement five for durability until the end result of the prepared mix is masticated|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|they really do keep getting better with each wave i remember when the first couple of mini plush pokemon were pretty small had some sloppy work on the stitching and overstuffing was a big problem poor buizel but with these last two waves ive yet to see a bad one jirachi here looks incredible and exactly as he does in the stock picture on this page when i saw it in the store i picked it up immediately because i couldnt believe this was a standard mini pokemon for the regular pricejirachi is very cute and cuddly and well made too he cant stand up on his own because most of the weight is in his head but its not because its overstuffed his little legs dont really help with standing the blue tasselthings on his head are really the only thing you need to be careful with since they could tear off easily but im sure most people who get this guy regardless of age will be cautious with them it doesnt show up in the stock picture but he does have a little smile instead of a neutral   face the eyes mouth and pocketthing on his stomach are sewn in so theres no worry about eyes coming off just like the other mini plush pokemon if he gets dirty youll want to use a damp cloth to clean him upi highly recommend getting this guy soon before prices go even higher what im saying should be obvious but it seems like the legendary pokemon from each wave hooh lugia celebi jirachi etc are the ones that collectors go for first the only time ive seen jirachi in a store was when i got him  months ago so hurry now while the waves still available for retail dont give in to the secondary market prices yet|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|im burned out on the legendary or rare oneofakind pokemon thatve been in the last  generations of the games because of how many there are now and phione definitely isnt one of my favorites but like i said with jirachi and others from the last couple of waves of mini plush phione looks great anyone who likes phione or manaphy will love this little guy and even people like me who dont care much for it will at least feel a little guilty looking at that little happy smile on its facephione is about the same size as your standard mini plush pokemon but the antenna tentacle thing is pretty long when extended he cant stand up since he doesnt have legs so if you display your pokemon hell need to be propped up for youngsters who play with them phione is super cuddly and soft thanks to that big head the eyes spots on the forehead and mouth are all sewn in while the red on its stomach is fleece i feel like a broken record talking about the pokemon from the recent waves but phione looks exactly as he does in the stock picture which is a good thing though the colors are a bit more vibrant inpersonthe only negative about phione is a minor one but it has to do with the durability of the toy the antenna tentacle thing is pretty thin where it connects to his head and could easily be ripped off so be careful with that area otherwise theres nothing to look out formy daughter had to have phione when she saw it in the store and since we got it for her im kind of taking a liking to the pokemon its cute and is one of the more unique looking blue ones in the collection and for fans of the character its onpar with the japanese releases which go for  times the price as of this typing you should still be able to find phione in stores so dont give into inflated prices yet|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|im starting to sound like a broken record with the mini plush pokemon thatve come out this year and in late  but theyve really hit a home run with all of these guys celebi is no exception and one of the best nonjapanese plush pokemon ive ever seen regardless of size this little guy was hard to find every store we went to had all the pokemon except celebi one of my daughters favorites but after weeks and weeks it was spotted and i turned my hat sideways threw a pokeball andok no i didnt but i wouldve if i had a pokeballcelebi looks perfect it can sit up on its own there isnt any overstuffing the eyes are very neatly sewn on the antennas are both the same size and the different greens are identical to the stock pictures here i never thought too much of celebi but after seeing it up close its really cute when you see it celebi has a cute little smirk on its face and with how the arms are it looks like its telling you it was thiiiiiiis big the wings are felt but sewn on well so theres no worry of them being pulled off easily still theyre the only thing that might qualify as fragile about this toy this is a fairly sturdy plush pokemonwhile its not as impossible to find as lugia and hooh were celebis mighty popular its been a month since i got this one and ive still yet to see another anywhere this is one of those few times where i say that the inflated price its going for as of this typing isnt that bad of a deal|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|mimic sculpts are hard to find this shouldnt be the case  the monster has been in dd for decades  but its something of anomaly for sculptors  on the one hand a mimic that hasnt yet revealed itself is simply a chest  and unless you use miniatures for every single object in a dungeon its a little weird when most of the objects are drawnin or printed out and you suddenly plop a chest down on the battlemap so almost all the mimic miniatures unilaterally display the mimic revealing itself  always a big pair of jaws  sculptor julie guthrie manages to make the mockingbeast a lot of funthe mockingbeast isnt just revealing itself its leaping to attack by extruding a foot beneath it  little beady eyes glare mischievously from the top  fangs bristle from the top and bottom of the open chest that forms its mouth and a tongue swirls insideits odd that reaper didnt just call the mockingbeast a mimic virtually guaranteeing nobody finds it who wants it  this is an old sculpt too a mediumsized figure harkening back in the days when there were two types of mimicsthats right kids there were once two types of mimics smart ones who would negotiate and big dumb ones that would just try to eat you they were differentiated chiefly by size with the smaller ones being the smarter of the two this also made the bigger mimics far less successful as they had an overwhelming tendency to masquerade as chests no matter how large they were  which is enough to make most adventurers poke the foot wide chest with a stickdd  blended the two types into one creature the big scary kind that tries to eat you with some of the intelligence of the smaller kind  pathfinder split the difference and made the mimic mediumsized which suits this sculpt just fine its hard not to love this little guy|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|when i was in high school i collected the megaman x model kits that were released in japan there were quite a few to collect and build and back then i was pretty happy with how they looked as time went on however i wanted something more poseable those old kits could only do so much and were usually stuck in regular standing poses enter these model kits by kotobukiya that finally give megaman fans the freedom to pose their models if youre new to these kits and this is the first one youre buying keep one thing in mindyoure going to be putting this dude together yourselfthats right when you open the box youll be greeted by many different frames holding all the pieces that make up protoman and youll be snapping each one off one by one putting him together with help from the instructions if you were hoping that protoman would be assembled like hes shown in the stock picture right out of the box youll be disappointed and maybe even intimidatedafter assembling protoman you end up with a very good looking figure in fact this is probably the best protoman ive ever seen in this scale about  inches tall all the details are there the scarf looks great and protoman has no problems standing up on his own even in more extreme action poses he has ball joints to freely move the arms wrists and other areas and comes with a good number of extra hands and even a total of three facial expressions you can swap out the shield can be held in either hand or stored on his back if you wish i have zero complaints with the appearanceto an extentthe big problem is like with the old megaman x model kits since youll be snapping these off the trays therell be stray sharp bits of plastic think hangnails on toys sticking out of him unless you have a hobby knife or fine file theres no way to really take care of these easily apart from using the utmost concentration when removing pieces from the trays its this reason alone that makes me wish this had been assembled from the start so all those little imperfections wouldnt be there check anyones pictures of this model and youre bound to see the little sharp bits because protoman is a model and not an action figure hes also prone to falling apart easily its easy to swap the hands out for other ones but its just as easy for a leg to come off by accident my last minor gripe is that i feel this model and the others in the megaman line are a bit overpriced especially when you factor in shipping from most retailers that much for a small model while the articulation might justify the price i cant help but feel these should cost a little less but hey megaman fans wont care when they have their own protoman doing some cool poses next to their other figuresso as long as youre fine with putting this guy together and know that some extra work is needed to get rid of the toy hangnails by all means go for it but for more casual megaman fans i say pass and just get one of the much cheaper figures that were released over the last few years in most toy stores ironically those ones are more durable|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter had been wanting operation for a while but i wasnt sure shed care much for it and none of her friends or cousins had the game for her to give it a shot shes also a huge nbc fan since she was a little over a year old so i knew this would be a cool present for her if only for the fact that its nbcbased sure enough she loves it and has played it a few times through the day inbetween playing with everything else she got im surprised at how fun this game is too since ive honestly never played operation in its regular form just the giant versions at family arcades and the like in the chance that you were on the fence about buying this one its worth buying for anyone looking for a new take on the classic game or just any nbc fan you knowgetting the game set up is simple first things first though youre gonna need two aa batteries and a phillipscross head screwdriver to put them into the back of the game kinda lame that they werent included but most people have two aas laying around so its not too big of a deal the batteries are needed for the game to recognize when the tweezers or funatomy parts touch the sizes of the area theyre in and for oogie to talk and for his eyes to light up after thats taken care of you just need to put the funatomy parts bugs snakes dice etc where they go next you separate the game cards into two decks doctor cards and specialist cards shuffle the specialist ones and deal them face up to the players the doctor cards get shuffled and put aside face down near the game board one of the players gets to be the banker and their job is to give money to the players that successfully perform operationsalright now for playing the game the first player takes the top doctor card from the deck and reads it aloud it tells you which funatomy part to remove and how much money youll get if you successfully remove it using the tweezers try to remove the part without touching the sides of the hole the part is in if you touch the sides oogie will say something and his eyes will light up and your turn will be over if this happens the funatomy part stays in the hole you keep the doctor card and the person with the specialist card for that funatomy piece gets to try if theyre unsuccessful too the doctor card gets placed at the bottom of the deck but specialist cards are kept until the piece in question has been removed if you get the piece without touching the sides though collect your money from the banker and discard the cards for that piece the winner is the person with the most money after all  funatomy pieces have been taken outi liked that the specialist cards net you twice as much money as the doctor cards making the players try even harder to do a god job the first time around so the next person doesnt get a lot more money the oogie boogie board looks great and its fairly wellmade the voice samples are few but it sounds just like ken page oogies voice actor from the movie and the lines fit the character perfectly the things i dont like about the game are small nitpicks first the money is just standard paper money similar to monopolys this means itll be ripped and bent up as time goes on but it also means you can easily make more of it with the right colored paper and a copying machine just remember kids its not good to try that with real money second some of the funatomy pieces seem a little too bulky for the holes they go in i know part of the challenge is getting an oddshaped thing out without touching the sides but a few pieces like the spider snake and scorpion were tricky and took us several turns to get out without messing up the only other minor gripe is that the game couldve been a little more sturdy like maybe with weighted legs for the board to stand up on the ones that hold it up are ok and do their job but this game is easily moved again these are minor complaints and dont affect the score much since the games so much fun and they dont ruin the playability of it oh and i guess some replacement pieces wouldve been nice since theyre so small and just one colorthis nbc operation game is very much worth the money and sure to be a hit with any fan of the movie regardless of their age i didnt think id enjoy playing it as much as i have i wish we had cool variations of board games like this when i was little maybe ill give the nbc jenga a chance next|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i just saw this set in the store today and nabbed it immediately upon seeing the cool new pikachu figure im used to seeing him standing up with a super cute look on his face and sometimes one where hes got his head tilted to one side forget those this ones made for battle of the three sets in this wave the others being giratina palkia and dialgaand sky shaymin darkrai and arceus this one stands out the most for that very reason unfortunately it looks like this wave of figures is already reusing some that were just released over the last couple of years so chances are if youve been keeping up with the pokemon figures for a while youre going to have some extrasregigigas returns once again with what looks like the exact same sculpt he had not too long ago you can move his arms and legs around and the sculpt looks pretty good whats funny is hes supposed to be a pretty big pokemon but the other two figures in this set make him look itty bitty even in this scale manaphy looks very good sporting a happy expression on its face and looks like its floating around in the air pikachu looks like hes ready to thunderbolt anything that gets in his way standing on all s and with his ears slanted back the expression on his face is all business and i cant stress how cool it is that we finally get a pikachu like this heck more pokemon figures should come in less neutral poses you can move pikachus head around and his tail comes off pretty easily though it safely goes in his rear without any real risk of breaking but this is something that i can see a lot of people losing because of how easily it comes off so watch out for it or make sure your kids keep an eye on that thing when playing with their pokemonyou shouldnt have any problems getting this set in stores right now so dont fall for the high prices out there in fact i think this set just came out this past week maybe two weeks ago so its very new im giving it  stars overall because while the awesome pikachu carries this set and manaphy is very cute too i dont get why the heck they gave us another regigigas already why not include a pokemon that weve still yet to get like marowak miltank or torkoal still this is a good deal if you dont already have hi so its well worth the price not a bad deal for  pokemon figures|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|last year my daughter fell in love with the big pterodactyl pillow pet and to this day she still has to have it on her bed when she goes to sleep as soon as she saw this little version of the pterodactyl it was clear that the big one needed its babybasically this smaller version of the pterodactyl is identical to the bigger version in every way except for the size its made of the same ultra soft material stuffed just right without anything being lopsided or overstuffed and none of the materials used to make it feel cheap im giving it the same ratings in every category as i did the bigger version although now that the price has went down on the big guy to just a few bucks more than this one i cant help but wonder if the same thing will happen here either way if your kids liked the big pterodactyl theyll love this one too and in the chance that you cant afford the bigger one have you seen how much they charge for that thing in stores this is a perfect alternativetheres nothing to watch out for as far as safety goes some sites and commercials still say that you can put these in the washing machine when they get dirty but i suggest using a damp cloth instead just to ensure that it doesnt look all ratty after coming out of the machinethe only thing keeping it from getting  stars is the fact that the regular sized pterodactyl pillow pet costs slightly more than this and if it came down to it id go for that one instead still this is an adorable little pillow and i cant wait to see my daughters face when she sees it|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my daughter loves her disney dolls but has shown a real interest in more realistic dolls when she goes to friends houses  therefore i really wanted to get her a realistic doll  the appeal of adora is that they make a very strong line of dolls which means you can go through all of them with your child and pick out the one that is perfect for herwhen the doll arrived my daughter was so excited  we got her out of the packaging and she sat her down to have tea with her  she kept playing with the hair a lot and was a little sad that she had a fixed hairband so that she couldnt do as much with her silky blonde hair as she would have likedi was surprised at the high quality of the doll and the realism  shes quite weighty and has real diapers  of course she has a face and hair that is more like a toddler along with legs that are more like a newborn bent inwards and wears a diaper so that part is less realistic but cutemy only disappointment was that it takes some effort to get her to sit up my daughter is always sitting her here or there to eat breakfast watch a movie etc  it takes her a little bit of effort but not badthe expression is cute and innocent  i did have a comment from another family member that she was a little creepy but that of course is a perspective based on how many horror movies you have seen|spam

A2WS6FMF750EI9|thanks so much dad for allowing my daughter to consort with a demon in the guise of a goofily prissy bear yeah shes made tough and washes and dries well can put bear into washer and dryer but can she bring to life that inner artistic spark that yearns to be free no the idea behind this  high ursine stuffed animal is that you can do graffiti and tags all over her with the included markers markers are abnormally large and thick resulting in less control for rugrats they are also doublesided so you get two markers instead of four the colors are pink green yellow and blue the yellow and pink are stamp markers the tips are small stamps in the shapes of a star and flower they are ineffective there is a high price attached to this thing  at walmart will be what you fork over i was wondering what the deal was behind this bear why did fp create it to encourage kiddos to deface the living room walls with sharpies after the bear has lost its charm or to be on the save wavelength of adults who did that in their childhood and thought it was cutely rebellious and original it just projects this feeling of i dare you to draw on mego aheadwhats the matterit wasnt fun my daughter colored on it for a minute she wanted me to wash her and then after she was dried she never did it again i lucked out anyway in the interest of saving parents everywhere who covet this type of stuffed animal time and money i decided to perform a little experiment i located a stuffed animal that came as close as i could get to the outer material that the bear is made of marked up my melody on her tush with both an fp marker and a washable crayola and washed mm she came out perfectly free of any marker markings so if you crave temporary damage hit your local goodwills stuffed animal section grab up some cheap washable markers and go to town future therapy averted|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is probably not only the best figure of lando as a general but also the best figure of lando the head sculpt really captures billy dees likeness as well as his fro the cape beautifully drapes over his shoulders the strap in the front is a bit thick but it doesnt bother me too much it keeps the cape in place as opposed to those little strings that sometimes move around too much while there probably isnt a huge demand for lando in his generals uniform id definitely recommend it for fans of the mon calamari briefing room in jedi|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the vintage line just keeps getting better this guy was a background character if there ever was one yet hasbro put as much care and love into him as if they were making a star character maybe more the face has an incredible amount of detail even compared to other alien figures in the vintage line you can actually feel the scales on his head and touching them feels like touching a snake however what really makes fi ek sirch stand out is his incredible cloak its got a very rough feel to it and has a slightly tattered look best of all drapes perfectly over the figure this guy is easily the best of the attack of the clones wave of the vintage line  and that was one of the better waves thus far|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its nice to get a version of luke that hadnt been done before this version is similar to the pilot luke but scruffier the only thing that would have made it better would have been a bit more dirt and swamp gunk on his outfit|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|this luke pilot figure is fully poseable and has two light sabers on and off mode that can be attached to a hole in the costume very nice detail if you ask me and a pistol that fits in the holster  helmet is removeable and nicely detailed  a great action figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its no secret that jabbas guards from wooof to the gamorrean guard are the best figures of the excellent vintage line the weequay skiff master is no exception the paint and detail are absolutely beautiful the tunic looks appropriately sandworn and dirty even as the quilted quality is apparent even the pistol is of superior craftsmanship the points of articulation are very well hidden this guy puts the potf weequay to shame  and shows what wonders an update of that figure could do|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|bariss offee isnt the most exciting character from aotc or the clone wars shes pretty sedate however her outfit and dark green skin does give her a mystical look this figure is definitely the ultimate rendition of her what i really appreciate is that hasbro managed to make her feminine but not frail you can pose her in action poses and she holds them well recommended for collectors who collect prequel jedi|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|everybody knows that the cantina aliens are some of the most popular star wars figures bom vimdin is one of the best of the lot the first vintage cantina alien the level of detail on this guy is amazing the jacket and utilities look like actual articles of clothing the face looks a hundred times more realistic than the actual mask used in the movie the figure is fully articulated but all the joints are so well hidden even experienced collectors will hardly notice them even the weapons which i was worried about because they werent in the movie are superbly done and actually look like they might have come from the figure i cant rave about this guy enough  its close to the level of the vintage gamorrean guard figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|hasbro did right by the tartakovsky clone wars with this figure this is the red arc trooper commando from the cartoon short in volume  its an incredibly detailed figure hasbro got the paint and detailing down perfectly hasbro also loaded him with articulation and accessories the hip joints allow you to put him in any action pose with the two helmets and two bandoliers you can create many different versions of the arc trooper in short hasbro set a new standard for clonetrooper figures the only problem is that hasbro didnt make enough of them and theyve become quite expensive so its tough to army build definitely recommended for fans of the tartakovsky clone wars|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|when my daughter opened her vinylmation box opened the foil around the figure inside and got peteshe was disappointed so she gave him to me hey petes one of my favorite disney villains and was the one figure in this line that i really wanted so that was fine with me to me he translates the best to vinylmation form and im glad we got him on the first trypete is the usual  inches in height and you can move his head and arms around the paint on my figure is very clean and i dont have any issues with it aside from the usual dastardly expression on petes face i love the back of this figure which has a little mickey mouse hooked around the strap of petes overalls looking like hes being yanked from the wheel the figure is sturdy but it loses a point in durability because the arms can easily pop off if you pull at them pete comes with a matching sticker that you can see in the stock picture above but doesnt come with any accessories which is my only big complaint for this line i know a box of chewing tobacco like in the steamboat willie cartoon wouldnt have flown so well with disney now but something extra wouldve been nicewhile i definitely dont recommend buying him on his own for the price hes going for on here at the moment vinylmation pete is a cool little figure to have on the shelf why arent there more figures of him hes one of disneys best villains|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|when you think about it the idea of a board game using legos makes a lot of sense  there are plenty of other games that involve building or destroying things  dont break the ice and jenga being two examples  so it was only a matter of time before lego entered the board game marketlego champion like most lego games is extremely simple at least in part because the game is translated into multiple languages  most of the instructions include visuals but unlike typical lego models the game requires little in the way of design the playing board is a rectangle made up of black lego pieces the pieces are connected by green lego blocks which also act as spots for each lego piece to movethe game is for three to eight players of age seven and up  the box includes nine lego microfigures ranging from skeletons to pink ladies one of the microfigures is a bizarrelooking oscarlike statue that wears the crown on its head  the trophyguy is goofy to look at but its nice to hand someone the trophy when they win  i call him the loscar in addition to the colorful characters theres a pile of blocks that come with the set in blue green orange pink purple red yellow and white  these colors are important because they correspond to results on the customizable diethe customizable die is a staple of lego games which has soft rubber edges and removable face plates for each side of the die  although you could technically use the sixsided die as is the fun begins when you attach colors to it  these colors correspond with what happens on your turn  if you roll green you advance to the next green block if you roll any other color you put that color down on the black track and then take on one of the lego challengesthese challenges are actually minigames  three of the challenges are physical on target requires the players to play a form of bocce by tossing bricks at the die closest wins topple the tower works like jenga in reverse with each player adding bricks before the tower falls over and speed builder requires players to build a copy of the first players model using one of each color bricktwo of the minigames are mental challenges code break requires the other players to guess the color order in which three blocks have been built bluffing bricks requires all players to grab three bricks and then guess how many of one color is held in their collective handsplaying these games with my fouryearold was insightful because it shows the variance in each game lego champion on the one hand is pretty simple  simple enough for younger players  but on the other it requires manual dexterity and memory skills that little ones might not possessfor my son on target and topple tower were easy enough but he had difficulty with speed builder  the mental challenges were fine but i found the two of them to be too similar  in fact i was surprised that there was no pictionarystyle game that involved more building perhaps this was due to there being another lego game just like it creationary  if lego champion has a flaw its that it doesnt really embrace the building aspect of legos  im all for memory games but if im playing a game with legos i want to mess with the structure of the game itself  theres no rules to change the rather boring black track for examplethere are however ways to change the game by changing the dies faces  one way to make the game easier for kids is to switch out one of the faces for a bowling challenge which is exactly like it sounds you set up six blocks and then bowl them over with the die  not particularly inspired but certainly kidfriendly  some suggestions on how to make the game harder or easier for different players would definitely help adults who arent sure how to change the difficulty for players of different ageson the other hand its evident that lego assumes youll figure out how to customize the game by yourself  its lego after all  game taking too long  shorten the track want to change the challenges  switch out the faces on the die i came to the startling realization that with lego champion i could conceivably create every basic kids board game in existence if i put in enough effort  chutes and ladders and candy land look outbut then i could do that without regular legos too  if you strip away the game structure you have the die and the figures  which i plan to use in my heroica games lego champion is simple in its presentation but with literally endless possibilities it deserves a rulebook larger than two pages lego veterans will have no difficulty modifying lego champion to suit their tastes but the rest of us may take a few games to get the hang of it|spam

first i was frustrated by all the pieces and components which range from weapons to magic items to monsters to terrain  some of the blocks are just set pieces others are critical to the game and still others seem to be replacement partsi stuck with it while i built the set as closely as possible to the accompanying poster my son was content to play with the hero pack a combination of hit point counter monster trophy coin purse and equipment rack if you lose a hit point red cones or gain gold gold cones you simply add or subtract them from your hero pack  if you defeat a monster or purchase an item you add it to your hero pack  and just like that lego got around the fact that the microfigs have no arms and condensed all of a typical heros adventuring gear into one convenient packagethe entire game pivots on the outcome of a die roll  the lego die are configurable although theres not much to configure in heroica like there is in say lego champion  instead each face has dual purposes either for defeating a monster or moving  unlike most games a  isnt a failure but a draw  in combat if you roll a  you defeat the monster but also take damage and move back a space if you roll a shield the  you get a variety of special effects or maximum movement  the special effects trigger at ranged while youre moving and before youre adjacent to a monster and in melee  items also provide special effects on a shield roll although curiously the axe has the same power as the barbarian which guarantees no barbarian will ever actually wield an axemovement is tied to range attacks so you roll every time a character moves even if he only needs to move one space in the hopes of rolling a shield  wizards can eliminate monsters without fighting them at a distance of  squares in any direction while bowwielders can eliminate monsters in a straight line at  squares  each hero has only  hit points and monsters range inflict damage from  to  points of damage it wasnt long before i took the purple skeleton microfig from lego champion declared him the lich lord and gave him the ability to inflict  points of damageitems ranged from healing potions heal  points speed potions move additional  squares torches increase your speed by  until you take damage chests that might be trapped or give gold and weapons ranging from daggers to staves  its unfortunate that the lego dice does not allow overcoming chests and rocks at a glance like combat and movement youll need to refer to the rulebook to figure that out but the variables are easy enough to rememberthere are three different adventuring archetypes that come with nathuz barbarian wizard and taking a page from dd rogue  in addition to the aforementioned abilities the rogues shield roll earns gold and defeats the monster since it costs  gold to purchase any item acquiring enough treasure can change the balance of the gamein addition to the bats  point golems  points and the golem lord  points there are rocks  these rocks require a roll to overcome with a shield moving the hero right past the rock  rocks are actually more difficult to overcome than monsters because on a  or  the hero moves back a space  this creates an interesting effect for wizards wherein a wizards repeated failure to overcome rocks can trigger his monsterzapping special ability  the dd player in me is tempted to change the rogue ability to remove any rock formation within  squares as a shield ranged ability thats the thing with heroica  kids love it and older gamers stroke their chins dreaming up how to tweak the thingnathuz comes with two dungeon configurations but it didnt take long to start messing with the dungeons layout both configurations dont use the entire set of torches boxes and potions so im fond of cramming in everything just to make things interesting  additionally i usually create a twopronged path approach to the end goal and take the opposite path of whatever my son decides so were not tripping over each other i was concerned about how much this would impact the gameim pleased to report that nearly every game has been neckandneck right down to the very last monster  player choice pivots primarily on movement  you fight a monster once you move near it so your options are what resources to burn and what resources to chase after death is temporary  you roll the die and heal the amount on the next turn  so the primary inconvenience of defeat is that you lose precious time to your opponentthere are rules variants epic heroica which my son is fond of playing allows each hero to hold onto his equipment earn gold for whoever defeated the most monsters and play again battle heroica sets up one player as a dungeon master controlling all the monsters  my first tweak was to make it so that equipment was a oneshot deal  in epic heroica item bloat becomes a problem and equipment attrition ensures that players are still hungry for goldas if the possibilities of the nathuz set werent enough heroica sets are compatible with each other adding new heroes equipment and monsters  and of course the microfigs can be used from any set ive got my eye on that lava dragoni could go on and on about the beautiful simplicity and endless possibilities of heroica  but dont take it from me  my boy has asked to play the game every night for two weeks straight|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|its kinda funny with how long the lps line has been going that theyve only just now gotten to a kiwi bird better late than never huh but this little one is an exclusive and there are only two ways to get itget all the stickers included with the current wave of specially marked pets and mail them intake the easy route and buy one on the secondary marketi wont lie i went the easy way and didnt pay anywhere near as much as people are asking on here now was it worth it definitely this is one of the cutest pets ive ever seen showing off those bambi eyes and the spiked feather look is really cool it comes shipped in the box you see in the stock picture and doesnt have any accessories why not no clue but they shouldve included something even if its something recycled thats the only reason im not giving it  stars overallbut even then i dont regret buying this especially since i ended up paying much less than i wouldve buying all the figures just for the stickers but dont get suckered into paying a couple of tens for this one even with how cute it is have you ever seen the movie thirteen ghosts i liked that number just saying|spam
A2WS6FMF750EI9|i decided to get this toy because of the very reasonable price and because of the possibility that the box size would seem impressive under the xmas tree it was i knew the hype had died down as i would always see these sprites on sale right before xmas of  strangely enough i would never see the wand just the sprites i am glad that i did not decide to just get a single sprite this wand is ultra cool it is  tall has a loudlouderoff switch sound is bearable and shuts off automatically when not in use after two minutes the wand takes four aaa batteries so have those on hand it is hard for us to keep track of what wand button does what we just push some and wait for the fun to begin it is actually not difficult to utilize so no worries the sprite is  tall and she has an onoff switch she came with batteries already installed three lrs she will go into sleep mode after twelve minutes of being ignored her pod is  tall but has little function in our situation as we are not planning to get a sprite treehouse pod has a hook for hanging all main parts are plastic at least on the outside you also get a ish lightweight cardboard flower that has petals of different colors on either sides ok this is the cool part when the wand is on and in the right mode you place the wand upright onto anything that has color and is flat re the included flower and the wand will actually pick up that color and the color will appear in the top bulb press the right button and you can then transfer that color or any that you desire to the sprite the wand does retain all pickedup colors the color library but it will not pick up colors that are too dark the wand comes with ten and you can pick up about fifty more the wand offers two games color hunt and color mix color hunt involves the kid matching colors that the wand requeststhis game has levels is best used with the flower and razzes you if you pick an unmatched color we got to color mix once but i have no idea how and i cannot get there now with that two bulbs in the globe glow with separate colors that combine to create a new color i tried to get to the cold heat and night spells but the wand became possessed after i messed with it too much the troubleshooting guide offered no hints with that problem do not turn your back on those sprites|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ive had several yoda toys over the years but this one is hands down the best i absolutely love him close to perfectionfirst i should say first of all that yoda looks a lot better in person than on the box the yoda on the box is a yellowgreen whereas in person yoda is correctly colored in fact the paint job really captures the look of the puppet in empire strikes back  the one area where the paint job gets a bit sloppy is on the edges of the fingernails and toenails fortunately you can actually gently scrape away some of the excess white paint with your fingernail and itll look perfectyoda comes loaded with articulation and accessories he comes with  extra pairs of hands an extra pair of feet with curling toes his cane belt necklace pouch a bundle of sticks as a diorama piece and essentially a bench and a bendable snake the sideshow exclusive edition comes with an orange snake as well but i couldnt find that one the extra hands are nice as they really allow you to capture the character at different moments you can have him gripping a cane or pointing towards the stars in short you can pose him just about any way you wantunfortunately sideshow is not producing his figure anymore this figure can be expensive on the secondhand market however if you love yoda from the original trilogy no less this guy is worth every penny in fact holding him in my hands now my only regret is that i didnt search a bit harder to try to get the exclusive edition with the orange snakethis is the first star wars figure ive gotten from sideshow and im very impressed its convinced me to buy thesideshow yodas dagobah hutto give yoda a suitable home|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|it seems like every bioshock figure i get is even better than the last first i got the elite bouncer then rosie subject delta and subject omega the quality of the figures was consistent and these are some of the few toys in recent memory that im actually excited to get in the mail just the other day the light up big daddy bouncer arrived and while i like to go into things without expectations i had a feeling that the big dude would not disappoint mei was rightthe big daddy bouncer with light up eyes isnt just the best of the bioshock figures ive bought so far hes one of the best figures ive bought in all my years of collecting any fan of bioshock who collects figures needs to have this in their collection if they dont already the bouncer looks fantastic when you have it right in front of you hes about the same height as the elite bouncer save for the little red bunny earthings the elite one has and has a good amount of weight to him the bouncer has articulated shoulders elbows wrists upper legs and lower legs something weird i noticed is that unlike the elites harpoon the bouncers drill doesnt rotate as for the sculpt its deadon the straps the dents in the armor the grill over the helmet the tanks on the backeverything looks incredible just like they shrank the game model and somehow took it out of the gamethe light up eyes feature works perfectly the switch is on the big daddys back between the tanks when activated the eyes light up until you switch it off red is pretty bright green is very bright and yellow was the least bright with my figure i dont know if its intentional or not but i noticed a lot of little gaps around the eyes when i turned the lights on in the dark some light shines through the area around the eyes that should be metal still this is an excellent feature and when you turn the lights off you can pose him sitting down to look like hes been defeated just like in the gamethe only thing to watch out for with this guy is to make sure nothing happens to the head since the led lights are inside the head it had to be hollowed out instead of being a more solid piece like the other bouncer figures the plastic isnt weak or anything but its at a bigger risk of being broken then the others so just be careful that hes not placed on the edge of a shelf or anything where tipping over could mean doomi highly recommend picking this figure up now before prices increase even more at the moment a few online comicfigure shops have him for the original retail price so look around before paying double|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|immediately upon seeing pictures of this game i thought itd be one of those many board games that didnt work like it should think about it the classic connect  is just a tray that stands up and you drop in yellow or red checkers trying to get four in a row its a simple concept that anyone can understand and play but this two different trays that are laying down the ability to block or take the opponents spot and you have to launch your pieces it sounded insane and yetthis game is incredibly fun and addictive connect  fans will more than likely enjoy this version but if youre the kind of person who doesnt like games of chance it might not be as funplaying the game is easy one player is red the other is yellow you place your rings on the little launcher press down on it and let go launching the ring into the top or bottom tray whoever gets  of the same colored rings in a row wins sounds easy enough but if you play by the instructions both players are supposed to launch their pieces at the same time and that makes things hectic rings flying all over the place bouncing off eachother landing on top of the other players piece and taking their spot i love it both trays are in use and if your opponent isnt paying attention to the bottom one you can take a quick victory by getting four in a row down there there are other ways to play mentioned in the instructions that include clearing out entire rows with specially marked rings and these ways are fun too but i like the basic method you have to move the launcher around to get just the right spot but even then your ring could bounce off the tray or land between spaces and not go in any of themkids ages  and up shouldnt have any problems playing the game and its the same kind of frantic fun that can be found in games like hungry hungry hippos connect  launchers is wellbuilt and doesnt feel cheap even the launchers themselves feel solid i highly recommend this game the only thing keeping it from getting  stars is the current price ouch if you can get it for around  of that or less of course its a much better deal|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|ive played this several times with my  year old and with adults  the commands can be hard to hearunderstand at times and it can be a bit confusing it was a great ideal to have a jack for headphones  but in the age of computer games it does feel repetitive and gets old after awhile its a bit too hyper for adults to enjoy together and really needs an older kid who wont get frustrated if they dont understand the cutsey voice  as well didnt like the obnoxious attempt at humor either  you can give a game a personality without it being like salt on an open woundas such it really isnt played with much any more|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i was a bit leery of this set since the promo pictures honestly looked horrifying  but in person they are actually much better  faith hills expression isnt quite so scary and tim doesnt look like a  year old in a suitfaith comes with a big smile and dimples and  toned blonde hair  her dress is of a net overlay with beige satin underneathtim comes with a woven cotton suit boots tie and trademark hat  his beard is painted on in broad strokes  not the best detaili wasnt looking for a faithful representation of the singers but i did expect for the cost of this set that the fashions would be of better quality  honestly faiths dress and plastic earrings are cheap  better suited for a fashionistic than a barbie collector doll  the dress especially feels very cheap  and tim is in a simple cotton suit with molded boots and plastic hat  ive seen better ken dollsfrom five stars im taking one off due to the cheap materials used and another star off because the expressions on both dolls while not as bad as the promo pics really do neither artist justice|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|a year or two ago when i first saw the singamajigs i thought they were one of the cutest kids toys to come out in years a bunnylike design good size and a cool singing feature that changes the vocals when you squeeze their hand make for a more interesting toy than some of the other must have toys that came out around that same time since theyve come out there have been a lot of different variations of them and this snowman one is easily my favorite while he sings jingle bells and the packaging is full of red and white theres nothing mention of that c word that upsets so many people for some reason these days still this would make a lot of kids have a merry christy christmas ooh see what i did theresnowman works just like any other singamajig you squeeze his tummy to make him sing one note at a time and press his hand to change the mode the three modes are song harmony and chatter song is the jingle bells song harmony is more of a choirtype of singing that sounds really cool and chatter is just weird talking sure to make kids laugh when they first hear it as strange as it sounds i think the harmony mode is actually kind of beautiful if you look past the fact that a whacked out snowmanbunny is singing itthe toy is pretty durable but i get the feeling that like most other plush toys with an electronic box inside its toast if it gets wet i cant say for sure though and im not going to experiment to find out just be careful that nothing gets on the stomach to clean him up id recommend using a damp cloth mixed with laundry soap the only other thing to watch out for is the scarf since its so thin its just one piece of fabric and can easily rip since its not reinforced with any stitching theres nothing i can see thatd be dangerous to kids under the recommended age for this guythe singamajigs are some of the better plush toys out there the price is right the singing feature is nice and theres a ton of variety with all the designs they have the snowman definitely stands out and would make a perfect stocking stuffer|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter absolutely loves okami not a single day goes by without her mentioning something from the game be it amaterasu the different gods dog power the satomi power orbs the water dragon and more she got me the chibiterasu pillow for fathers day but has since claimed it as her own so of course getting her this little chibiterasu plush was a sure thing i was a little disappointed by the quality of the pillow since the red markings were printed on instead of being their own material or even embroidered and unfortunately that carried over to this plush toochibiterasu is much bigger than i expected standing at about  inches tall hes made of the same soft fleecelike material as the pillow in fact hes basically the same as the pillow except that its in a more normal form this time the materials design of the head and wings on the legs are nearly identical here he has a plastic nose and plastic eyes and nothing here could pose danger to small childrenso why the  stars one star is docked because of the lame printed on red markings as i said in my review for the pillow these things are going to crack and fade away over time if you squeeze or press the areas where there are markings you can see how weak these are luckily there arent that many markings on chibiterasu but its still a problem my other gripe that takes him down to  stars is something that was painful to look at as soon as i took him out of the box chibiterasu has no neck his head is coming out of his body like a frog and it looks weird theres a reason you dont see any pictures of him from the side and just see him at an angle or faceforward in stock pictures you cant help but feel bad for the little guy when you see how misshapen he isbutjust like i said in my pillow review there isnt much okami merchandise out there so we gotta take what we get i dont recommend spending more than retail on this guy unless youre a diehard okami fan i wish this plush chibiterasu looked better because i hate giving him an average score this is still a good sized plush that will look good on a shelf as long as you dont have him facing left or right|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|okami fans dont have much in the ways of collectibles or merchandise a couple of promo items here and there the limited edition of okamiden in japan a freakin silly bandz bracelet of chibiterasuits pretty lame but with the recent release of okamiden a couple of things have hit the market and its not just in japan this time enter the chibiterasu pillow the second i saw this thing i went awwww out loud a pillow of chibiterasu whats not to love the little pup is only one of the most adorable game creatures of this generation and many people were hoping to bring it home in one form or another i opted for this pillow over the regular plush because its more unique and because i knew my daughter would like it too as she loves pillow pets whether or not youll be using it as a pillow is entirely up to youchibiterasu is smaller than i expected about  the size of your standard pillow pet its not made of the same lush super soft material but instead feels like basic fleece the tag on its rear reads material nylex teicot velboa fiber and has no washing instructions but its safe to assume that surface wash with a damp cloth will do the job chibiterasu is stuffed perfectly with no lopsided areas and the ears are perky and stand up without flopping over the little wings on its legs are sewn on and you close chibiterasu into nonpillow form via two buttons and loops of string his nose is made of plastic and his caboose has a black x sewn in but when it comes down to being used as a pillow chibiterasu is pretty comfortable its not too soft and not too firmbut this cute little guy has a couple of problems my main issue being the cheap printed on red markings and black eyes nope the red markings arent a different color of the same material used on the body it looks like it was just ironed on its extremely cheap looking and if you do use this thing as a pillow expect the red to flake off over quickly the paws have little grey prints too this was the first thing i noticed upon taking chibiterasu out of the box and i wish they had put a little more effort into the design theres no question that any pillow pet is of better quality than this why is the nose plastic but the eyes arent i also dont think the loops of string that go around the buttons are a good way of securing the legs as the strings are thin and feel like theyre going to rip off a portion of chibiterasus sides with them just be very careful when opening and closing this guyi cant complain too much because the price is around the same as a pillow pet and this is more of a niche item but it wouldve been nice if the eyes were sewn or plastic and the red markings werent so cheaply applied this would still make a great gift for any okami fan and looks great displayed on a shelf or bed id get one while its still a new thing though because this is the kind of thing that will likely shoot up in price shortly being a cool item for a cult classic game dont miss your chance|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|this barbie delancey is what id call a midrange doll  there are a lot of cut corners to lower production costs but it is still usually a step above the knock off barbie type fashion dolls  delancey is a side character in the movie  the blair doll features the main character  as such i recommend purchasing blair first before delancey purple or hadley bluedelancey has a purple tiara purple plastic necklace thin ribbon made into stays in the front of the dress socks and shoes  a tiny plastic purse comes as an accessory for this doll blair has a computer and hadley comes with a ball  each of the girls dresses have a topper that matches their personality  delancey is the princess of the group so her dress has princess ribbons in the front and princess sleeves on her dress and thats why she comes with a purseto cut corners delanceys belt dooes not continue to the back of the doll its not as noticeable on delancey due to the way her dress is designed unlike blairs missing peplum i consider this a bit of a cheat because you cant see that until the doll is taken out of the box but this doll is clearly meant for very young girls who likely wouldnt notice or caredelancey has clickbend legs but the arms are stationary her hair is in two long ponytails with cheap elastic holding them not very princesslike  note that she doesnt have any undergarments  another cost cutting featurein all i feel she is worth the money for the playacting but is clearly meant to be disposable|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i didnt care much for the first muppet set of vinylmation figures that came out some of the characters didnt translate to vinylmation form very well and the fact that kermit the most important muppet was the chaser left a sour taste in my mouth but series  is a lot better in my eyes and has good diversity for being mostly secondary muppets the only thing keeping this series from being  stars is that while disney is finally doing more with the figures by giving some of them hats i still wish theyd give some of these real accessories to hold in their handsthis set consists of the pigs in space crew most of the electric mayhem band pepe lew zealand scooter a penguin and the chaser is waldo c graphic while its cool that they made the chaser an obscure character i have a feeling most people will wonder who the heck he is if they get him my favorite figures of this set are zoot dr teeth lew zealand and the penguin zoot has a removable hat instead of it being painted on like most figures oddly dr teeths hat is painted on instead of being a removable accessory and it makes him look stylin now if only he came with a little saxophone thatd be the finishing touch all of the figures come with collectible cards as well though i hear this trend might stop soonfans of the muppets will probably collect all of these as the majority of this set are popular characters and vinylmation collectors will probably dig them too even if they dont like the muppets this is a very colorful series with lots of fun expression and i cant wait to see whos in series  if it gets made|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter doesnt have that many girly toys aside from littlest pet shop stuff i dont mind it at all since when i get a cool toy she wants to play with it too but now shes really getting into monster high dolls and i think its great if i were a young girl living in this era these would be what id be going for as well granted the outfits are on the skimpy side for a couple of them this one included but its a nice take on dolls and monsters and compared to other doll lines out there like the moxie dolls its not a huge blow to your wallet whenever you buy a really good onethis version of draculaura features the doll wearing a cute black and pink top with a pink mini skirt she also sports thighhigh black socks and white fishnets on her legs and arms and you can easily remove her outfit to switch it with another thanks to velcro on the back her shoes dont seem to be removable not easily anyway so the socks and leggins will probably stay with em too also included are pink skull earrings that pop into her ears with little pegs and stay in much better than i expected my daughter opened up her monster high dolls on christmas and weve still yet to lose the earrings draculaura has some nice articulation too much more than i was expecting you can move her head around in all directions shoulders elbows wrists upper legs and knees the brush she comes with works like any doll brush should and is a slightly different shade of pink than the pajama draculauras overall the design on this doll is awesome and whoever designed her deserves praise the pink and black theme she has looks good and they made it work with the hair too the facial features like the eyes and mouth are painted perfectly and i really have no issues with this doll as far as its appearance goesthe only things keeping it from getting a full  stars overall may or may not apply to everyone first the prices for her are a lot higher than i wouldve figured this doll doesnt have any really unique accessories so id look around for a good deal before ordering her right away then again i did manage to get her at a store when they were having a huge sale on monster high dolls but still this doll should only cost about  of what she does at the moment the other issue is more of a collector thing and its that the legs dont stay up when you pose them high the stand they included is a light but does its job and if youre a collector and want your dolls to be in more than a basic standing pose getting a cool fighting stance or something wont work then again it could just be the doll we got so maybe its a quality control thingeven with those itty bitty issues draculaura would make a great addition to any monster high collection my daughters always playing with this doll and i think shes already played with it more than she has her disney princess ones i wonder when draculauras going to start being a bully and steal someones crownor horse|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|man ever since i was in the th grade when donkey kong country came out ive wanted a diddy kong toy youd think with how huge the game was we would have gotten some cool stuff of the little guy but no there was nothing aside from a few nintendo power catalog exclusive goodies and then the eleven plush that came out during the nintendo  era then there was a diddy kong racing toy line which was cool but it was impossible to find those guys anywhere for some reason aside from those and a pez dispenser exclusive to europe i cant think of any other diddy goods that were releaseduntil last yearlast year there was a three pack of the kongs donkey diddy and dixie for the super mario mini figure line donkey and even dixie had been released on their own before while poor diddy was stuck in the set and couldnt be bought on his own well this past weekend while browsing through the toy section at some store with a big red bullseye i saw diddy on his own and all was well in the cosmosdiddy kong fits in with the other figures in this line perfectly hes a mere two inches tall but paired up with donkey or dixie looks just right this iteration of diddy is more from the donkey kong country returns one with the nintendo logo on his hat and the yellow stars on his tank he stands up without tipping over as he rests on his knuckles just fine unfortunately there arent any articulated joints or limbs on the little monkey its not a big deal since thats how this line goes from what ive seen but i was hoping you could at least pose his arms oh wellas with all the other super mario figures the paint work on these toys is very sloppy so if youre a collector look around before buying to find the one that looks best ordering online is a bit of a gamble plus you have to deal with inflated prices given that i havent seen diddy in the last couple of weeks or the other new mario toys im pretty sure that hes brand new and finding him will get easier over the next month or sostill for diddy kong fans this little toys is a steal at the original retail price|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|its about time amazon has these listed the mini plush from black and white have been out for over a month now as soon as they hit stores i was excited to see how the new pokemon fared in mini plush form given how great the last couple of waves were of the old pokemon i thought everything with these would be just as good sadly thats not the case but sandile is definitely the one to get this little dude is the biggest of the mini plush in series  and looks the best ill be reviewing most of the others too but if you havent seen any of the black and white mini plush inperson yet just wait because if you go and order some you may end up disappointed with the quality of the otherslittle sandile is cute but also looks like a tough customer he looks exactly as he does in the stock picture above and is made of the same soft material as the previous mini plush hes about  inches long and has stitched eyes mouth and nostrils the different colors are all separate pieces of fabric and they arent just printed on he stands up on his own but tends to lean forward because of how big his head is whereas most of the others in this wave feel and look cheap sandile stood out immediately and i think hell be the rare pokemon of this loti really like this little guy and love having him on my deskwhen my daughter doesnt kidnap him anyway but dont get suckered by the high prices for something thats still just now hitting stores across the country a good place to check would be that one storebullseye is the name i think right no hmmits something similar i guess|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|while sandile is easily the best of the new pokemon mini plush tepig isnt too far behind him if it werent for one glaring problem it might have been a tie between the two anyone who loves the little fire pig should get one of these fast because we all know how hard to find stuffed versions of the starters are once people start to notice thesetepig looks just like he does in the stock picture above and his ears stand up perfectly on their own without flopping over tepig can also stand on its own without falling over or leaning forward thanks to good design and balance all the colors look great and the eyes nostrils and mouth are sewn in i love the facial expression with the eyelids down and little smirk of all the fire pokemon plush we have tepig is one of the few that stands out next to torkoal and monfernobut as ive said in my other reviews of the black and white mini plush in this wave quality is an issue many of the tepigs ive seen have lopsided heads due to too much stuffing in one side of the head look around and you should find a pretty good one my big problem that knocks the rating down to  out of  stars overall though is how they made the tail surprisingly its curled up just like in all the artwork of the little pig pokemon but its sewn against his body and the red ball at the end seems to be a part of its backside rather than being its own thing it looks really weird and almost like a button more than anything else i dont get why they couldnt have just used a pom pom or made a standard fabric ball and sewn it against the body instead of making it look like its a part of it its an eye sorethats just something that bugged me and i doubt many others will notice it especially any kids that love this pokemon as usual this is a pretty new toy and easily available at any stores that carry pokemon stuff so dont pay the online prices that are already up to  times standard retail|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i think overall this is a great version of zam wessel shes got a lot of accessories including a rifle blaster two headscarves a helmet with goggles and best of all an alternative head shes a shapeshifter the scarves are a bit tricky to fit in but when you get them in they look great however that said i wouldnt say this is a musthave figure unless youre a fan of zam wessel its definitely the best version of her but you probably wont be bowled over|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the super battle droid isnt my favorite droid from the prequels but its an essential part of any separatist army set that said hasbro did a stellar job with this one the weathering is perfect he looks like hes been in dozens of battles the articulation is probably as good as it could be it would have been nice if hasbro could have given it ankle and wrist joints but the appendages are probably too thin for that highly recommended|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is by far and away the best version of mace windu weve had yet the articulation and paint are of course all we expect from the modern vintage line more impressive the facial sculpt looks a lot like samuel l jackson you can definitely see his stern expression in the figures eyes and creased face and the robes fit him perfectly they hang on his body and look like a natural fit overall this is probably the second best figure from the attack of the clones wave right after the nikto jedi|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily the best version of kit fisto the articulation is all one could ask for and the paint job is superb this is definitely the definitive version of kit fisto the only complaint i had is with the hood because of kit fistos head tails the hood doesnt really fit well over his head even more frustrating if you want to display the figure wearing the robes but with his hood down the hood doesnt really fit under the head tails so theyre covered its a tough problem and im not sure how hasbro could have solved it but it is a problem nonetheless otherwise highly recommended|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i have mixed feelings about this figure i think hasbro got a lot right the face the jacket and accessories are all great yet the hair really bothers me its a fairly bold white and really sticks out also most of the body is the from thestar wars original trilogy yoda action figure the elbows only have swivel joints not ball joints this is particularly troubling when you try to pose yoda in a fighting stance with his lightsaber his range of motion is limited id recommend getting this yoda if you want to have a duel scene with darth sidious however if you just want a yoda especially an original trilogy version check out the otc figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i dont know if its just my version or what but this luke skywalker figure has very thin legs and theyre too close together the legs are attached to the hip via ball joint so its still possible to position him but i find he still really only stands well with a stand also his face looks a little too california boy for my tastes its not a bad figure id give it  stars overall but just isnt one id recommend going out of your way to get if you already have  other versions of luke|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|logray has seen several rereleases over the years truth be told the original potf version wasnt half bad and could still be used as a generic ewok today however this vintage style logray goes way beyond its predecessors first the paint and sculpt look extremely realistic and a bit grittier hes got about as much articulation as is possible for such a small figure with ball and joint hips and shoulders however what really makes this wicket better is the accessories he comes with a removable headgear spear and staff next to the vintage wicket this figure is essential for any fan of return of the jedi|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|im a big fan of the star wars eu figures at least kotor heir to the empire and njo and was excited when i heard bastila shan was going to become a figure however when i first saw the photos of her i was a bit worried fortunately i received the figure recently and really am impressed for whatever reason this figure isnt photogenic but she looks beautiful in person just like bastila shan in the game the likeness is pretty spot on and the outfit is perfect shes a thin figure but even so manages to pack  points of articulation even more important all of that articulation is well hidden and blends with her outfit there also seem to be far fewer paint misapplications on bastila shan than most other star wars figures the only bad thing i can say about this figure is that it doesnt come in a pack with canderous ordo or carth onasi im crossing my fingers that hasbro keeps making such good kotor figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the rebel fleet trooper has always been a fan favorite all the more so because it was never released in the original vintage line the first version from the potf wasnt bad but was a bit on the muscular side later versions were better but not perfect this vintagestyle version is near perfect the figure is fairly lanky and looks more like the hapless troops on the tantive iv the accessories are fantastic the trooper has his standard gun hand binoculars a strap of grenades around his ankle his trademark helmet  no less  and a baseball cap all of these accessories are removable if you see more than one of these definitely get a few  theyre ideal for troop building|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the vintage collection really delivers with this version of ponda baba of course as with all the vintage figures the paint and sculpt jobs are beautiful and the figure has as much articulation as one could want what makes ponda baba really special are the accessories  or in this case the removable arms first you can remove the right forearm and leave a bloody stump in its place second and even better the figure comes with two types of hands  flippers and regular hands  as a monument to the infamous blooper in a new hope when the character was seen with walrus hands in most cuts but his severed hand looked more like a a hairy apes hand its a cool feature and one that should be required for any ponda baba figures in the future my only complaint is that the jacket is attached to the body and isnt removable personally id always liked the removable jackets just because they hung on the figures better however with the removable arms i can understand why hasbro might not have wanted to mess around with a removable jacket overall this figure is a great tribute to the most infamous part of the cantina scene|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|i had been trying to make a hoth collection and this action figure was a nice addition  it cannot have a seat as his outfit is made of plastic  it is well sculpted  other than that the picture describes how it is  good joints but outfit restricts poseability  this character is the one who tells the officer about not being able to find luke before echo base doors are closed|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the echo base trooper certainly isnt the most exciting figure nor even the most exciting in wave  of the vintage collection bastila shan or ponda baba win on that count but he is a good figure for army building as usual the articulation and paint and sculpt are all great oddly enough though this figure still has a weak center of balance i had trouble getting him to stand even on fairly flat surfaces he will stand but i feel like a bit more maneuverability in the ankles might have helped|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|whether you should buy this product or not depends on a few things really so ill get the simple one out of the way first does your child enjoy the leapfrog learning toys and books if they do and have been using them for a little while then by all means go for this bundle its a fantastic deal comes with way more than i was expecting the shipping box for this bundle is massive and will keep your child busy for a while with all the books included here however if your child hasnt used the leapfrog products before or doesnt stay interested in them for very long this probably isnt going to change their mind at the same time i cant help but wonder when teaching children how to read suddenly went from being taught by parents to being taught by a big talking peni was blown away by how long it took to get this thing set up after downloading the leapfrog connect application i had to go through a long agreement and then wait for an update to the software then i got to make an account for myself then a profile for my daughter where personal datastats are needed after this youd think everything would be done right nope an optional survey pops up as well as a window for email addresses of family members to get updates about the tag jr i suggest doing all of this when your kid is doing something else or asleep so they dont expect everything to be working right away after unpacking when all of this is finally done you have the option of personalizing the tag jr or downloading audio for the books this is where the big disappointment comes in the tag jr has all of mb of memory i agree with the other reviewers who bring up how cheap an gb flash drive is these days and wonder why they couldnt have given us more only a few books can fit on the reader and i wouldnt be surprised if there are some books out there that take up all of the memoryaside from those annoying issues the products included here are pretty good you get a ton of books the reader and the carrying case all of which are durable and look cute the reader is the perfect size for children in the recommended age group and the audio comes out clearer than a lot of other talking toys released these days im still not big on using something like this to teach your kids how to read but this is one you could count on it doesnt go through batteries like crazy either which surprised me big time but the most important thing is how it works and everything works like it should and you can do different things in each book while this bundle is a great deal id still recommend getting a few real books with longer sentences to keep the childs interest since the ones in this set are very basicnormally id go on about the product more but i ended up giving this bundle to someone who didnt have much and wanted their child to learn how to read since theyre having trouble with it so i only had this set for a short time but still say its worth your money|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter loves pillow pets and seems to get a new one every couple of months be it from a relative or by picking one out with her piggy bank money but recently it was my turn to get a pillow pet after i saw the new buffalo one who if you ask me is one of the coolest ones theyve made theres no special feature on him hes a plain brown color and theres no extracute appearance like the teeth on the pterodactyl pillow pets or shimmering material on select others but really did you ever expect them to make a freakin buffalo pillow pet of all the animals and creatures out therea buffalo made the cut for a minute think about how many iconic animals there are that you always see yet still havent gotten the pillow pet treatment for that reason alone this guy is worth picking up theres not much more obscure you can get for a bed decoration than a little pillow buffalo and while my daughters more or less stolen him from me despite this being a christmas present for me seeing this dude always puts a smile on my faceas is the norm with pillow pets the buffalo is made of the usual ultrasoft material and there are no small parts that could pose a threat to young children unless theyve mastered the eagle claw technique and can take the eyes off stuffed animals with ease the buffalo can be folded up as seen in the stock picture with the usual flap with velcro on it allowing him to stand up on his legs when you undo this he flattens down a bit and can be used more as a pillow than in the previous form the velcro on this strap is sewn in very securely and theres no worry about it ripping or tearing after countless uses some toys out there that arent official pillow pets but are more or less the same thing use buttons and that usually leads to durability issues the buffalos horns seem to be made out of fleece and arent pointy the fur on his head front legs upper back and the tip of his tail is shaggy with the rest being shorter like most pillow pets theres also the official logo patch on his backright hoof on the undersidethere are no quality issues as far as ive seen when ive checked this dude out at the pillow pets kiosk when shopping or now that i have him in my possession this could just be a slight problem with mine as i didnt notice it before but the long fur strands on the tip of his tail arent as full as those on the rest of him there are just a few tufts here and there it doesnt look bad but its still noticeable no big deal though and i doubt kids will notice it if this is something that all of the buffaloes have the care instructions on the tag also say that you should put this guy in a white pillow case with the end tied and then throw it in the washing machine with cold water running honestly id rather be on the safe side and stick to using a damp cloth with cold water as ive used with other pillow pets in the past but its up to you theres always the risk of messing up the fur or making the stuffing uneven after its been washedthe buffalo pillow pet is right up there with the orange pterodactyl and pink triceratops for me and ill probably get the bigger one somewhere down the road if your child happens to like buffaloes this would make a great gift or hey if you like weird things it makes for a great decoration on the couch or on a shelf get him before the price shoots up|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|seriously how stoked were you when it was announced that rita repulsa would finally be immortalized in action figure form i remember dreaming about finding a rita figure at the store when i was little and a huge mmpr fan but one was never made for some reason or another we got practically every bad guy from the show except for her even finster was made on more than one occasion but here we are and the rita figure has been hitting stores for a whileand im seeing tons of them still sitting there on the shelf where the gold white and green ranger figures were instant hits and sold out quickly they had all been made many times before but with the first ever rita being released you think shed be the most rare figure of the current power rangers toys nope this is one ugly figure and only the most hardcore of hardcore collectors should bother getting this thingrita is as plain as you can get ironic that this is labeled as a collector item right she sports the absolute worst paint job ive seen of the classic character figures with two black spots for eyes and a pink bar for her lips there are parts of her dress that arent painted including the boots that you can see under her dress and they didnt even bother painting her rings or anything either her wand fares slightly better but even here they couldve done a better job rita barely has any articulation either with the main ones being her shoulders and elbows granted she didnt do much in the show apart from screaming at her cronies and throwing her wand but itd be nice to get her in a cool pose instead of just standing around looking like a ditz with that blank look on her face and although they dont show it in the stock picture her rufflething around her neck is included in the box its poorly painted too and snaps into her neck making it easy to remove if you ever want to do i even need to bring up the manly hands too look at those things with those skinny lanky arms and huge hands she looks like the lost love of pumpkinhead or somethingid like to say that it hurts me to give the lone rita figure one star but thatd be a big lie i was hyped when it was announced that shed be one of the classic figures but as soon as i saw it inperson i laughed out loud i still laugh when i go to the store and see  of these still in the same exact spot they were the week before dont give in to any higher than standard prices online as you should have no problem finding this sick puppy at any store that carries the samurai line but trust me when i say that youre better off buying some pop tars or maybe a nice new toothbrush|ham

A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|y wing is perhaps one of the most famous ships after the x wing  it was piloted by luke in the animated cartoon of the very old christmas special that featured boba fett you may find it in youtube i believe  it also was part of the first attack run in the death star trench but they never got to fire to the target  in the star wars simulators it is shown as a slow ship but its design is quite coolnow lets go for the review on this toyit has some features one seat very detailed cockpit that includes a retractable targeting computer a moveable gun on top of the cockpit front landing gear should be manually deployedretracted while it has a handle to retractextend rear landing gear a button on top to drop a missile that hangs under the ship room for a standard astromech droid red paint job and engine exhaust nicely paintedthe cockpit is very tight so it is hard to fit a pilot inside mostly because of the handles that pilot has to control the ship  i was lucky to find the pilot pack that contained an astromech and two y wing pilots but even they are hard to fit inside  when you pick a rebel pilot action figure be sure that it is as poseable as possible ball articularions in the arms and knees or you may not be able to put a pilot inside  for example there is a pilot luke that has no such articulations and he does not fit as well as biggs action figure  so buying the right action figure for this ship is a tricky task  one less star for thatalso finding an astromech droid may also be an issue  for example the sail barge version of rd does not fit because of the cables in the legs of the droid do not fit inside  you need to remove or retract the center leg so it fits insidethe missile is barely hanging so it may easily fall as it is not strongly attached  a kid may loose it easily  also the astromech may fall if the ship is inverted they did not add any type of device to secure the astromech so it does not fall  it is just a hole to put the astromech inside  it may be disappointing for a kid to put an rd inside and have it falling and discover that the antenna is broken  so as i see it it is a toy for collectors not really for kids unless parents are star wars geeks who select the action figures carefully and kids do not plan to put a pilot inside and then remove itthe ship is very detailed on top and bottom but it has generic details in the sides giving it the look of a toy like the details in the side of the old diecast metal version of millenium falcon that had generic details instead of a collectors artifact  the paint job is red not yellow as in episode iv  it has a rear window which is not movie accurate as in the movie it had a metal panel  and it has a panel behind the pilot instead of just a seat where you could see through the rear side windows as in the moviethe cockpit panel is very detailed but not movie accurate but more detailed than older versions  so in that respect i like this version better  this ship always had some visual cool factor and even if it is not  movie accurate it is a nice classic ship which is valuable in terms of nostalgia but not sculpting or paint jobthe paint job is mostly for the nose and engine exhaust and the rest is beige painted pipes not battle damage  the rest has a plain color as it relies on sculpted details  and since side details are generic it looks a bit more like just a toyso if you are a parent looking for a nice experience for your kid you now know that this may not be the best toy for your kid specially considering the price that is too high sellers price  toys r us for   but if you want it for a stand and you do not bother to pay  extra out of nothing it is just ok it is a collectors item with the quality of just a toy for kids  its price is given by geeky nostalgia and some sellers greed not sculpting or paint job|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ig was one of my favorite star wars bounty hunters when i was younger however most figures of this guy were relatively stiff even the more recent hasbro versions of ig has much less articulation than most other figures one almost wonders how the droid could ever kill his targets if he can barely hold his gunthats one of the reasons i love sideshows ig so much he comes loaded with articulation his arms and legs dont just swing back and forth but also laterally this allows you to pose ig in much more dramatic poses in addition igs eyes light up with a deep red when you pat his headoverall ig has never looked so good  or moved like the assassin droid he is|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the first wave of black and white miniplushes left a lot to be desired problems like overstuffing and poorly sewn mouths were on nearly every plush i saw in stores and the overall quality just wasnt that great i was wondering if the superb quality of the last couple of waves of prebw plush was just a fluke fortunately it seems like the previous black and white miniplush hit a bumpy road and all is well again series  just started showing up in stores earlier this month and all of them are very wellmade my daughter picked out deerling and minccino first and well be going for the others soon even i went awww out loud when i saw this little pink deer on the shelfdeerling is incredibly cute and looks exactly as she does in the stock picture above she can even stand up on her own if you adjust her legs a little the material shes made of isnt as soft as the kind they used for celebi jirachi and the others in those waves but its still very soft and kids will love to cuddle with this little deer the colors arent too bright or too dull they looked about right to me based on the tag attached to her the flower on her head isnt as wimpy as snivys arms from the last series which is a huge plus in my book all the stitching and work on the eyes and mouth look great and i have zero complaints about her theres nothing to watch out for no areas that could rip or break easily but as usual if she needs to be washed use a damp cloth instead of throwing her in the washing machineof all the pokemon from series  i think deerling is going to be one of the two most popular shes too adorable for kids or parents to pass up and looks great with all the other mini pokemon and like i always say with these do not give in to the online prices these guys just came out and if theyre not in your stores yet just keep waiting i remember it took about a month before series  hit the east coast so just be patient and youll get a good deal and keep deerling in mind as a stocking stuffer too what pokemon fan wouldve love to see her head poking out of their stocking|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|sideshow has done it again where hasbro only gave collectors a cheap paper diorama background of the cantina in the late s sideshow provides a nice large bulky environment for our cantina figures and this cantina environment is large it easily fits the entire modal nodes band  members as well as one of the cantina tables two chairs and two figures seated in the chair the environment also has two lights that light up and a doublesided windowi have absolutely not problems with what isnt included the environment is pretty expensive for basically amounts to two walls and part of a ceiling the set doesnt come with any bar glasses stools or chairs however the thing i found most disappointing is the lack of a floor there is no floor at the bottom of the environment this really undermines the set it would have really completed the scene to have a floor to go along with the two walls and ceilingif you can afford it and love the cantina scene its definitely works wonderfully as a way to display your figures|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|with how long the vinylmation figures have been around it seems weird that they just now started doing holidaythemed figures id taken a break from collecting vinylmation figures for a while but when i saw this set at the disney store it got me back into everything seeing the lion king ones right next to it helped too if you happen to have a disney store that still has these they should be on clearance now so dont wait any longer if you wanted this cute pair the frankensteins monster mickey and bride of frankenstein minnie are a great duo to have in your collection and would look awesome next to the fanfavorite pumpkin mickeyboth mickey and minnie sport spooky designs with mickey looking disgruntled and minnie looking pretty serious the paint on both of mine was better than usual without any problems actually and most of the ones ive seen in the disney store had good work too aside from the faces theres nothing really scary about them in case any parents were iffy on them no bones or muscle or anything like that is shown this is as grated as you can get for the two characters these are based on its a fun take on the universal classics i personally like the minnie a little more just because of the hair speaking of that the hair on both of this might be removable but im not sure you can pull the hair off a bit from the figures its a very soft plastic but its either risky to take off because of how its molded around the ears or it might just be really loose i dont want to pull at it too much and damage the figures or hair in the process if you can remove it you can throw it on another figure and make a pretty neat variant its nice that the hair is a separate piece as to keep the figure in the traditional mickeyshapethe figures use the newer vinylmation figure bodies and they feel a lot smoother and softer i cant describe it any other way but if you feel these and then another vinylmation with the newer body theres a clear difference between the two it doesnt mean the qualitys bad but its something i noticed immediatelyalong with the weird smell these guys have a very strong odor when you open the plastic tray but it goes away once theyve been displayed for a while my only other nitpick is that the arms on these feel less sturdy than usual so be careful when moving them aroundeven with the small problems i cant give this set anything less than  stars the figures are cute would make for great cake toppers at a wedding or halloween party and are just the beginning of a new vinylmation line the box does say series  after all maybe next year well get a mummy and werewolf of donald and goofy im all for it|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|tonight was the first time we spotted a zorua at the store and of course it was purchased immediately zoruas my daughters favorite new pokemon and its clear that this guy is going to be the hard to find one of series  even though series  has the best assortment in my eyes anyway theres no question that this little guy stands out from the rest if only because of the colors and hey you cant turn down a little foxdog thing i was surprised at how wellmade zorua is since a lot of the other miniplush from the bw series havent been that great id go so far as to say that zoruas right up there with jirachi and celebi from last years linezorua stands at just about  inches tall despite what some others might say and stands up on his own without falling over the quality of the material used to make him is very good and extremely soft the same material is used on the little bits of fur that stick out on the sides of his face though things like this have previously just been thick felt with no texture similar to the body the stitching on the eyes nose mouth and red dots are perfect and not out of place anywhere and they nailed the color perfectly with it being an almost purpleish grey im not trying to make it sound like just because i like this pokemon that theres nothing wrong with it but there really arent any cons to talk about here its good to see another quality miniplush pokemon especially with one of the stars of bw as far as taking care of it goes in the chance that food or marker gets on him id just use a damp cloth with cold water and rub it out all of the pokemon we have have been cleaned this way without any trouble you can always machine wash it but theres a chance that the stuffing inside might get messed up and youll have a lopsided zoruaseries  has only been out in stores for a few weeks but series  and  are still easily available so its safe to say that if you cant find a zorua right now youre bound to find one soon enough dont go for the high prices online yet unless you absolutely need one for a special occasion|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|this weekend my daughter spotted the green summer version of the deerling mini plush at the game store we always go to i was surprised to see the newest batch of black and white mini plush so soon after series  just came out not that long ago i was even more surprised that they chose to make one of the pokemon in the batch an alternate color of one of the previous ones the pink spring deerling was super cute and stood out from the others in series  but this green one stands out just for being so dang cute theres not much to say about this little guy since its virtually identical to the pink one except for the green coloringsummer deerling is as cute as a button and can stand up on his own the eyes and mouth are sewn in with the same good quality of the previous nonblack and white mini plush lines and im happy to say that i havent seen any issues with quality with the couple of deerlings that ive seen deerling looks exactly as it does in the stock picture above too i always have to say that since sometimes stock pictures are actually prototype images and things change from the time between prototype and final product and it could lead to some disappointments but little deerling looks great and im glad my daughter picked it out though i wouldve been even happier with the mini dewott they did a good job with the materials and stuffing and nothing feels like its in danger of breaking or ripping what more can i say this is a great little pokemon to add to your collectionas much as i love this one its weird that its one of the more dull ones from series  series  has really picked up the pace with different kinds of pokemon with  of them being the evolved forms of the starters who all look terrific as well since thats the case i think deerling will be one of the less popular ones and it should be easy to find once they start hitting other stores in the next couple of weeks|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive had to cut back on buying vinylmation figures these last couple of months due to moving and other things that popped up but when the disney store had the lion king vinylmation display up i was floored everyone looked great the figures are colorful have great expressions and one of them even has gasp an accessory something rare for vinylmation figures i immediately fell in love with the rafiki figure and while i dont plan on buying all of them this is one set where id be fine keeping any that i gotthese figures use the newer vinylmation body that so many people are complaining about hardcore collectors throw a fit over any figures that use this body but you really cant tell the difference unless you have one sidebyside with an older body type or if youre that much of a vinylmation expert all of the figures are  inches tall with no short or tall figures and everyone here is a major character you have mufasa scar nala zazu rafiki tmion banzai princeintraining simba shenzi the baby lion some say its simba but im not sure pumbaa and the mystery figure is ed disney did a fantastic job with this line putting cool and wacky expressions on most of their faces ed has a crazy laugh look rafiki looks like hes pondering something about that crazy weather the hyenas look mischevious etc and what kids wont love the timon and pumbaa figures with bugs in their mouths im really glad they went this route instead of giving everyone neutral or smiling faces my personal favorites are rafiki scar ed and banzai rafiki comes with his medicine stick and he can hold it in his right hand its a small piece so be careful when opening the vinylmation box in case it pops out when you open the foil otherwise theres nothing to look out for with these guys durability gets  stars as usual since the arms can come off easily if youre not careful but since these are typically used for display its not a big deali dont think therell be a series  for the lion king since almost everyone is here in this set aside from adult simba adult nala and sarabiwhos left so this is an easy set to collect none of the figures are dull and even those with the least amount of color look great next to other vinylmation figures ive got rafiki kicking back with abe lincoln right now and it looks rad|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|neca has their ups and downs but with the gremlins line they seem to be at the top of the hill i liked the gremlins figures from the first movie that came out a while ago gizmo stripe and the poker player one but felt they couldve been a little bit better mohawk from gremlins  though just plain ruled and i couldnt wait to see if they were going to make the other zany gremlins from the sequel in figureform lucky for us they did the first one my daughter and i got from this line is daffy not exactly my first choice but when you see em on sale at free comic book day you just go with it daffy fits perfectly in scale with mohawk and features nearly the same great attention to detail on the sculpt and paintfor the most part daffy looks exactly like how he does in the stock picture the only difference i see between the picture and the real thing is that the spots dont appear in the exact same places and the spikes on daffys head arent as sharp as they look in the picture he sports some good articulation just like mohawk though mohawk seems to have better arm articulation still you can move daffys head shoulders elbows hands upper legs knees and feet getting him in fun poses is easy despite those short legs its hard for him to fall over they nailed the goofy expression on his face giving him the least menacing look of the gremlins apart from maybe lenny even those tiny teeth dont look very threatening daffy also comes with two accessories a pair of groucho glasses and a noise maker party favor thingy the noise maker can be held in his left hand but cant stay in his mouth unfortunately the glasses fit perfectly though and look great when worn they actually work well with other toys we have and also work with mohawk too just be careful when fitting them on his face the plastic is thin and could be broken very easily on thesethe only things keeping him from getting a perfect score are how hes painted and the price its not that the quality control on the paint is bad but the paint just looks cheap for some reason i cant really put my finger on it but comparing daffy to mohawk in the paint department is night and day he looks kindashiny and i really dont care for the price hike in the gremlins over the span of less than  years look for these guys in stores that carry him before giving in to online prices where hes a good  more than he should be not including shippingi get the feeling that well end up getting all the gremlins and you know what im fine with that these are terrific figures and great to have on the shelf i look forward to seeing even crazier ones when they come out like the spider mohawk lightning gremlin female gremlin and the infamous flasher|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|recently i found out that neca might be discontinuing the gremlins line and that the big hits like spider mohawk greta and others may not be released as a result that doesnt really change my rating for this figure or the other gremlins but if you want to see more of these buy them from legit businesses and support the lineof the three gremlins in series  george will probably be seen as the boring one look at the set daffy is a crazy goofy gremlin with unique eyes and fun accessories the flasher gremlin is an icon and makes for a perfect centerpiece to any toy collection georgeis a grumpy looking gremlin with a cigar dont get me wrong as i still love this figure but compared to the other two its hard to come up with a list of good things to say about him when you have daffy and the flasher in the same series george stands at the usual gremlin height of about  inches and sports the same articulation as the others neck shoulders elbows wrists upper legs knees and feet he has a nice olive green coloring with lots of black spots and markings as well as some small spikes on his arms head and face george also has different ears than daffy and the flasher his mean face shows that he means business and is ready to punt any mogwai that gets too closegeorges single accessory is a cigar it fits in his snarling mouth perfectly yet it can fall out if hes bumped even a tiny bit you can also put it between his fingers for alternate display i dont know what else they couldve given himmaybe some goodies from the musical number in the movie anything extra would be nice considering the price increase on these new gremlins compared to those from the previous line mohawk stripe poker playeraside from the lone accessory deal i have a few tiny complaints georges toes were bent upward when i opened the package the plastic used on the hands and feet is soft and things like this are common as a result the only way to fix this that i know of is to dunk the limbs in hot water for a few seconds then bend them back into place holding pressure for a few minutes and then cooling them off george couldnt stand up on his own for more than a couple of minutes with this problem and it sucks that i had to fix it myself in order for him to be displayed the paint used for my figure also looks a little shiny compared to the flasher and daffy it could just be my figure ive never seen george in any stores but it still doesnt look as good as the paint on mohawkthose problems arent a deal breaker though and he looks great with the other gremlins released so far george may not be a standout like the flasher or even the flimsy lightning gremlin but do you really want to pass up a figure in this line its fun to have a ton of gremlins i dont see the price on this guy jumping past the original msrp but itd still be a good idea to buy him now rather than later to show that people care about the gremlins figures so more get made|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|up until now mohawk held the title for top gremlin figure in my book everything about that figure was great the sculpt was perfect paint was excellent articulation was wellhidden and when it was released the price was very reasonable the newer gremlins figures have gotten a sudden price hike despite coming with less accessories than the previous waves but were getting many characters that never had any toys of them made before the flasher gremlin is easily one of the most memorable gremlins in the movies and when i saw that a figure of him was being made he shot to the top of my toy wish list unfortunately he either wasnt being sold at the usual big name toy store due to what hes all about or hes just so popular that he constantly sold out i had to give in and buy the set of three which included daffy and george but man was he worth itflasher stands at the same height as all the other gremlins in the line he has a more standard gremlin look with regular eyes and ears but also sports some spikes around the eye and jaw areas his jacket is made of soft rubbery plastic and is easy to open up once you get him out of the box everything looks great from the spots on his ears to the muscle definition in his stomach thats one thing i didnt notice about this wave until i had all three of them standing together some gremlins have different body types so this wasnt just a reuse the flasher has your standard new gremlin body articulation but you wont be able to do much with it due to the coat arms aside his head wrists upper legs knees and feet can all be moved the arms are articulated but again the coat limits what you can do at the same timewould you really want this figure to do much else aside from flash peopleas for his accessories all he comes with are a cigarette and sunglasses the cigarette fits perfectly in either side of his mouth and the sunglasses can be placed over his eyes as long as youre careful there are not slits or anything for these so you have to put them between the spikes on his eyebrows just right so they dont break the sunglasses are very fragile and i can see them breaking even when using caution be careful with the cigarette too since its so small and could easily get lostwith all the good things i have to say about the flasher gremlin theres just one negative thing the price he tends to go for double what george and daffy are i recommend buying the set of three to avoid overspending by buying them individually flasher gremlin is a definite standout and is currently the center of my gremlins display him and the first revoltech woody seem to be good friends at the moment|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive been waiting on a toy company to make a good chunli figure for a long long time it seems like no matter how big the company is or how much the figure costs theres always something disappointing about the chunli figures they produce neca dropped the ball big time with their stout blank faced abomination a few years ago with their sfiv figures medicom who nearly produced a perfected chunli had big problems with quality control on limbs the outfit and some figures were shipped without certain womanly parts on the upper body while thereve been many great chunli statues and model kits the action figure department is severely lacking when pictures of play arts figure surfaced i was very excited as the company makes some mighty fine toys with great articulation for months their chunli was at the top of my wish list and i finally got to see the figure inperson yesterday along with the other sf figureswell it looks like ill still be waiting on a good figure of ms perfect legsright out of the box chunli looks great she stands at  and a half inches tall right in line with ryu the face which somehow always gets messed up by toy companies looks great and her body is perfectly proportioned those fantastic legs of hers arent grotesquely huge like the neca figures and her arms arent too skinny a problem i had with the medicom figure a soft rubbery plastic is used for the lower portion of her dress and sleeves similar to the robe on the final fantasy x auron figure that play arts put out a while back the paint work on chunli is very good though i really dont like how shiny her outfit is instead of coming off as silk it looks like plastic ryu akuma and cammy dont have this problem so i dont get what happened here there are also different shades of blue used on the outfit making it look a bit off but not horrible surprisingly the boots were painted to have a weathered look this was a great choice and a pleasant surprise she comes with a total of  hands two closed and two open a kikoken fireball a stand for the kikoken and an alternate head with an open mouth removing the head is easy and the hair covers on her head come off effortlessly to put on whichever head you choose ms lightning legs also sports a lot of articulation as youd expect from a play arts figure head shoulders biceps elbows wrists upper body waist hips knees boots and ankles the upper body has a fantastic range of motion allowing for some good action posesgreat sculpt and many points of articulationso whats not to like as strange as it sounds both of those are also the problems with the figure the primary thing that took the score down is how ugly the knee joints are poor chunli has no knee caps here to cover the joint and it looks absolutely atrocious when you bend it want to get her in a pose that looks like shes holding a leg up to do a front kick its gonna look awful you end up with this eye sore that makes chunli look like she has some kind of prosthetic limb instead of something more natural i really couldnt believe how bad it looked and its no wonder you dont see stock pictures of the figure doing more than fully extended kicks or plain standing poses speaking of poses good luck getting her signature fireball stance as it appears on the box i sure as heck couldnt get her to do it her hip joints make exciting poses involving kicks very limited too because of how theyre sculpted but this isnt as big of a problem as the knees no stand is included with her either so as much as id love to be able to display her doing a spinning bird kickthats kind of impossible without a specific stand my last complaint is something most people expect from play arts figures and its easily breakable limbsjoints be very careful with the hip joints when posing her legs these come off easily and if youre not careful something can break here without any effort the same goes for switching out the hands i suggest sticking her handsarms in a cup of hot water for about a minute before trying to take them out if you cant get them out otherwiseits a shame that the knees look so bad and that you cant get really cool kick poses out of this figure because it sure looks great on display and yet it looks best in a boring simple standing poseor maybe in some kind of salute like she does before a fight starts as much as it hurts to say i wont be adding this to my collection any time soon if the price drops sure but at the standard price ill pass shes definitely not the worst out there and probably is the best figure so far but ill keep waiting|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|at the rate were going i think my daughters going to have every draculaura doll there is by the time summer hits she really loves this character and is getting into monster high big time for christmas she got the classrooms draculaura and the dead tired one too recently she picked this sweet  one out with some of her birthday money and she lucked out since it was on sale ill get the main negative point about these dolls out of the way first the price theres no denying that the monster high line of dolls are some of the coolest toys thatve come out in the last couple of years but the continued price increases are pretty lame especially when the quality or number of accessories that come with each doll isnt increasing that being said id suggest looking around for a good deal before jumping the gun on this doll unless you absolutely need it right awaydraculaura has hit her sweet  and its time to celebrate shes easily recognizable with her standard black and red hair cool makeup now with  more sparkles and pink skin she has removable earrings and a headband and her dress can be removed if you want to switch it out with something else draculaura also has the usual monster high body featuring some really good articulation so you can keep her in fun poses theres been a lot of negative points regarding her legs breaking easily but in the month that my daughters had the doll nothings broken on her so far her dress has a lot of nice detail to it and it almost makes sense to have this doll at the current price point because of it trust me it looks nicer than it does in stock picturesunlike most of the other monster high dolls ive seen when theyre not sold out in stores draculaura comes packed in a big box that shows off what initially looked like a lot of accessories but shes only packing a little bit first up is another one of the usual skull key clips a hair brush birthday cake a single solitary invitation to her birthday and an alternate skirt oh and theres a cute little purse in the shape of lips with fangs on it i thought that was a nice touch and itd be cool to see more accessories like this in the future for herof all the different takes on the character this is in my top  but with how much she costs that could turn off a lot of people again look around or see if theres a sale coming up nearby where you can get one for a better price if not its not like the dolls reached the cost of the pullip dolls or anything but itd be nice to get a little bit more in the package even some monster high stickers or something would help|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is easily one of the best star wars vehicles hasbro has made yet of course its awesome as the only example of a true sith ship we ever see in the films however hasbro did a particularly good job i really appreciate the fact that hasbro did not sacrifice the design or dimensions of the ship just so it could fit a figure i hated how the old millennium falcon had a huge cockpit and relatively tiny hull by contrast this ship almost looks like a model and is a nearly perfect replica of the one from the moviehaving said that there is a hidden missile launcher when you pull open the hull i guess this is for kids but even when i was a kid i hated when hasbro added these types of features on vehicles fortunately if you keep the hull closed its fairly inconspicuous i just pretend it doesnt existi did see that other reviewers complained about the size of the ship all i have to say is get real hasbro is not going to make a huge version of this ship  the company knows not enough people would pay for it this ship is rare enough to find and costs a good deal secondhand i got mine off ebay for a reasonable price but many are sold for double what i paid so no the ship is not scale to the darth maul figure however as a fan of the old action fleet line it is scale to the action fleet figures thus you could just use it as a ship versus say the naboo starfighter or the droid fighters i dont even bother to put my darth maul figure in the cockpit which is basically just greyoverall definitely get this ship if you are a fan of star wars vehicles  or if you have fond memories of the action fleet line|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this version of quigon is probably better than those that have come before but its not quite as good as the quality of the other vintage figures the head sculpt looks a bit dated and a bit too small or his legs too big the lightsaber handle is also way too thick overall its not a horrible figure but just doesnt seem up to snuff with the quality of the vintage line|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|to be quite honest ive never been a big fan of ben quadrinaros as a character he looks absolutely ridiculous and does nothing in the films except have his podracer stall on him he certainly wouldnt have been on my wishlist for hasbro charactershowever upon seeing this figure in a store i soon fell in love hasbro did an amazing job with ben the sculpt and paint detail are incredible he looks extremely realistic more so even than the animated version in the movie his skin is creased and wrinkled while his suit looks like its made of some leathery fabric as a piece of art this figure is stunning if you take to collecting star wars figures like artwork then ben is definitely a worthy addition to your collection even if you dont like the actual character|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure is definitely a huge leap from the  version of the naboo royal guard hes got all the articulation of modern figures his jacket is brilliantly painted with deep red and black highlights my only complaint is that the face looks a bit blaseacute the paint job is fine but not particularly interesting something seems a bit off maybe thats best for an army building figure but its definitely not quite as realistic as some of the other figures in the line|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|quinlon vos is an eu favorite but did make a cameo in phantom menace hasbro did this figure justice as with many of the figures in the vintage line the detail and sculpt are incredible his skirt is a mix of cloth and plastic which looks great the best part is his hair it really looks like he has curly dreadlocks overall a fun addition for fans of this complex character|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|as much as i like some of the clone wars figures opress ventress i can never get used to the humans their features are too angular as such i really appreciate hasbros making some of the key humanoid characters like anakin in realistic form this figure came out very well and can stand alongside any other figure in the hasbro line anakin looks like christian haydenson in between aotc and rots with longer hair but not yet down to his shoulders my only small complaint is that theres no way to attach the lightsaber handle to anakins belt thats become an almost standard feature for jedi other than that a neat figure looking forward to more realistic clone wars figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|there have been dozens of versions of darth vader figures over the years this figure is easily the best one to come from hasbro yet its got an incredible amount of articulation the sculpt and paint are incredible perhaps the best thing about the figure is that it is the new hope version with no removable helmet meaning you can pose it a lot without worrying about that helmet another great feature is that vader can grip the lightsaber with both hands unlike other recent figures that could only grip with the left hand definitely must get this one for your collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|finally weve got an imperial navy commander that is screen accurate has versatile articulation and correctly proportioned hes hard to find but if you can find him its worth getting a few for death star dioramas my only complaint is that underneath the helmet the figure has blondish hair it doesnt contrast very well against the light skin tone i think he would have looked better with brown or black hair|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this ship is from the tartakovsky clone wars hasbro nailed it the paint and detailing are incredible when you put the wings on its actually a pretty big ship almost as wide as an xwing what i love though is how the wings work the side wings fold up and down while the middle wing goes up and down so you can actually fly the ship in a bunch of configurations the cockpit fits an oddball or clone pilot figure definitely recommended for tartakovsky fans|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the minute my daughter saw the monster high school playset a few months ago she was in love with it shes loved the monster high dolls for a while and this year things really picked up i wasnt too sure about it based on the pictures and the original price but i knew i was going to get it for her as one of her big chri meanholiday presents this year sure enough it was a hit and she completely ignored a few other toys playing with the school for most of the day all in all this is a pretty cool doll houseesque playset though id recommend finding it for as cheap as possible due to how flimsy it is as a wholefirst i want to let you know that the box for this toy even states that the product within may look different from how it looks in the picture while not completely different there are several things i noticed once i started putting things together the clock appears to have a basic dark frame but it really has two pegs on each side and they stick out like a sore thumb the basketball hoops net is also completely black not white as it appears on the box these little problems arent anything major and they clearly say that there are some differences right there on the box but im wondering if that was printed on there right as soon as these started to get shipped or if complaints came in and they put the text on there a few waves laterputting the playset together isnt hard just a little time consuming with all the small pieces it shouldnt take you more than  minutes be very careful when inserting the sections as the walls of this toy are super thin at the same time be even more careful when walking around the school if its opened up one wrong step and this things toast even the little piece that more or less holds everything together a very smell hand doesnt feel like its going to resist much pressure it wouldve been nice if the construction was more sturdy and pieces snapped in place like many other playsets do in fact there isnt much here that snaps together a big problem i have with the product is the dj booth the speakersmixing piece does not snap in place on paper this might not sound like much of a problem but take a look at the product images above the only thing keeping it from falling over is the very short rail in front of it brush past the speakers it falls barely tap the playset walls it falls think about it falling it falls this is the single most frustrating part of the whole playset in my eyes because all it needs is a peg at least it makes me laugh when you turn this piece around it serves as a trophy case but the sticker was applied upside down nice going also be sure to look at the image of the outside of the school showing the gargoyles notice how only one of them is holding a book both gargoyles have books to hold and oddly enough the same one that isnt holding one has a lot of trouble keeping its grip why not just cast the gargoyles and books as one piecesome have said that the instructions should have covered every aspect of the playset i guess thats true to some extent but if youre having trouble putting together the cafeteria table i dont know what to tell youso was there anything i did like of course when constructed and you have all the accessories in place the school looks great not as great as it should have been but its still pretty dang cool the tables and desks fit the dolls perfectly and its nice that the outside of the building has a basketball hoop to add a little more imagination to playtime i liked the web pieces with the little pink pumpkins that dangle from them and we dont have any trouble with these falling off i was surprised that it came with as many accessories as it did i guess im just used to things like this not coming with much a nice bonus was the sheet of stickers for kids to put wherever they want the instructions dont show where they go so its up to the user and as i mentioned earlier this was the big winner of all my daughters presents she got this year i loved seeing her have so much fun with everything when the speakers werent falling overi wouldnt recommend paying the msrp for this playset at all it was nearly half price for the last couple of weeks at most major stores and thats a much better price for something so flimsy lacking any sound or action features im surprised that this was going for as much as it was when it first came out look for a deal or just hold off until it eventually goes on clearance you can get lots of other smaller playsets and cool dolls in the meantime|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|after the somewhat disappointing larger transforming cinderella carriage toy that came out recently i thought id give this smaller version a shot as soon as my daughter woke up to see it at the foot of her bed she was excited unlike the larger carriage the one actually comes with cinderella it may be smaller but honestly i think most girls will get just as much out of this carriage as they would the big onethe carriage stands at about  inches tall and is made of a slightly thin plastic i think calling it flimsy is a bit of an overstatement its fairly sturdy and nothing on it feels like its going to break off easily each of the doors are on a single hinge but theyre secure each wheel rotates on its own rolling along the floor without any problems the carriage has a decent amount of detail and is painted white blue pink and silver cinderellas horse attaches easily too i was surprised that the horse had realistic hair instead of sculpted hair fans of the my little pony toys will love this one too as for the future princess herself cinderella can get out of her outfit just by squeezing the dress this is part of the magiclip series so she can use other outfits from the line cinderella has limited articulation but its understandable for this size and price she fits inside the carriage perfectly plus theres room for  additional figures of the same sizefrom what i can tell theres nothing to watch out for no small parts that could be choking hazards in the chance that an infant got ahold of anything and theres nothing sharp either itd be nice if something more were included like maybe a sound feature or something that lights up or maybe a fairy godmother figure hey yeah why isnt she includedas it is this carriage set isnt a bad deal at all youre getting a carriage its horse and cinderella just think about how some toys like those   star wars figures cost about  this and youll see that disney could be charging a bit more for it this is a nice toy for those who might not be able to get the transforming pumpkin carriage or if youre just looking for something thatll take up less room|spam

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|i know that these figures are based off of the latest batman game arkham asylum on the wii but im not really convinced those who made these figures knew anything beyond thati can appreciate a good batman figure now and then this is one of the better batman figures  asside from the lack of definitive yellow oval behind the bat symbol i think its sheer laziness on anyones part when it is not includedunfortunately i cannot say the same of the defective black cat figure i doubt the powers that be know anything about the characterwhipthe black cat does not use a whipshe does have a tail which is clearly missingi consider myself one of the better customizers in the market so i cut up the whip and used gorilla glue with a toothbrush to attach the tail i sealed it with clear scotch tape and blended it together with a black sharpie marker medium tip|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|hasbros vintage collection has always been great but this wave of deleted scenes figures really raises the bar hasbro used a mix of cloth and plastic to make the desert overgarments look realistic and layered the goggles are a bit tough to fit under the hood but its not too bad if you just lift the hood a bit while you slide it over his head the lando figure itself is a new version of the lando in guard disguise and includes his helmet so you get two versions of lando for the price of one|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the vintage collection gets better all the time this time hasbro gives us leia from the deleted sandstorm scene in rotj hasbro mixed soft goods and plastic to make her look like shes wearing layers of clothes the goggles fit well on her face under the hood underneath the heavy clothes the figure is essentially the same as the vintage slave leia so its almost like getting two figures in one|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the vintage collection gets better all the time while this character was never seen onscreen it makes for a great armybuilder or background fodder for rebel hangars or briefing rooms the figure itself is great my only complaint is that the big gun is painted a uniform dark brown color it would have been better if hasbro had put a bit more energy into detailing the gun especially with rust or other colors to make it more visually interesting otherwise a perfect figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the rebel alliance certainly had its share of heroes in a new hope and the empire strikes back however something always seemed a bit odd the rebels were fighting for freedom from oppression and discrimination yet apparently no aliens had joined the rebel cause where were all the oppressed rodians and snivvians flocking to the rebel bandwagon were they all just hanging out in chalmuns cantina drinking their sorrows away alas return of the jedi introduced the first rebel aliens on the bridge of home one we see sullustans dressellians and of course mon calamari by giving admiral ackbar such a prominent role the mon calamari became the symbol of the rebellion  even hosting capitol of the new republic after the yuuzhan vong invasion however with the release of star wars on bluray we learned that george lucas was far from confident that the puppets used for the mon calamari would work onscreen in fact several scenes were filmed with general crix madine taking ackbars place on the bridge of home one  fortunately puppeteer tim rose did a phenomenal job bringing ackbar to life the bluray bonus features also include test scenes with an unidentified mon calamari  also performed by tim rose  piloting what looks like awing unfortunately this brave rebel pilot did not make it into the final cutto celebrate the release of those deleted scenes hasbro gave the mon calamari pilot the attention he deserves in s deleted scene wave wave  from what we can tell he is an allnew sculpt hasbro did not simply throw the mon calamari parts from the vintage admiral ackbar vc onto a preexisting awing pilots uniform comparing this figure with tycho celchu or green leaders uniforms its clear the rebel pilot mon calamari has a different uniform the tube connecting the chestbox to the belt is white not a metallic silver the white leg straps also hang on the figure more realistically almost as if drooping down the outer parts of his legs the shoes are also much larger perhaps because mon calamari have larger feet overall we think this version of the awing pilots uniform works better for the figure except for the chestbox the chestbox is smaller and flatter than those found on most rebel pilots also the buttons are not painted in the robinegg blue red and white colors that characterize tycho celchus chestbox of course its not clear from the test footage what this pilots chestbox actually looked like but we wish hasbro had just taken the chestbox from one of these other figures to make it look visually more interestingeven though the vintage admiral ackbar was one of our favorites hasbro decided to give this mon calamari pilot all new head and arms perhaps most notable is that the rebel pilots spotting pattern is a darker shade of brown while we think sometimes the spotting comes across as a bit too bold and doesnt bleed enough into the lighter brown it does effectively distinguish him from ackbar the head sculpt is definitely superior to ackbars and better emphasizes some of the mon calamaris features including his chin tendrils the pilots mouth opens wider than ackbars as if hes saying friend calamari tonight one of tim roses lines in the deleted scene the hands have bonier fingers and the jagged portions off his forearm are sharper than ackbars of course as with all mon calamari not named ackbar this pilot comes with a helmet its pretty faithful to the onscreen version except its missing the small microphone extending from the righthand side still the design is reminiscent of the helmets from the potf mon calamari fleet officers speaking of which customizers will want to get multiple copies of this figure in order to create more mon calamari officers its not a great fit but you can put the rebel pilots head on the admiral ackbar neck and put a little clay on the joint to keep it in place while its a shame this rebel pilot never made it into the final film were very pleased with the way hasbro immortalized him in plastic|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my  year old is an enduring thomas the tank engine fan but his second love has been the disney animated series jake and the neverland pirates which is based in peter pans neverland and peter pan guests in a couple of episodes  the only problem was that they only had one season for a long time and he grew tired of it after frequent rewatches  however recently there have been quite a few new episodes featuring jake izzy cubby skully captain hook smee sharky and bones that he has absolutely loved  my toddler likes it for the music which is very upbeat and funso you can guess how ecstatic my  year old was when he opened the amazon box and foundbucky  i couldnt get the ties off the back of the packaging fast enough to get bucky out for him  he played with it all night then took bucky jake and skully to bed  after that he and bucky were inseparable he even begged me to let him take bucky to school  i know that this is one toy he is going to play with for a long timethen at the end of the week i was an idiot i had my toddler in the bath and my son asked if he could get in  i told him he could once i got the little girl out  i was so busy drying her off that i didnt realizehe took bucky into the bath with him  bucky must have been submerged a full two minutes before i plucked him out  i touched the button that makes the soundsnothing  i felt so awfulwe took out the  aa batteries that bucky comes with and left him out to dry   hours later i put the batteries in andit works  i am so relieved  i am sure that the designers of this toy anguished over whether to make the first bucky a floating boat for the bath or a highend toy with electronics and im glad they made it a highend toy  there are so many responses when you push the gold doubloon button that it never seems repetitious  there is a ships bell sound and lots of music and jake talking such as woohoo and set sail for pirate island followed by music and water cannons go and bucky turn right  its great because my toddler loves it toothe good lots of different fun inspiring voices and sounds from the tv series jake and skully to play with on the ship both have slots on the bottom so you can perch them around the ship where there are pegs nearly indestructible  bucky has been dropped wrestled over and submerged and everything still works great and no broken parts interactive features three gold doubloon buttons one for sound one to launch the missles and one to open the port with tick tock the crocodile comes with  missles which have a large rounded front and launch with enough force to be fun but not enough to hurt anyone caught in the crosshairs has rollers on the bottom so he can sail around your house just make sure to have the water  bad conversation when rolled bucky rocks back and forth like he is sailing back door to put the characters ini dont really see any bad things  its pricey but i think the value is there  you can get other characters such asfisherprice disneys jake and the neverland pirates  jake izzy and cubby pirate packand other pieces such asfisherprice disneys jake and the neverland pirates  hooks battle boat  i need to getfisherprice disneys jake and the neverland pirates  jake hook and croc pirate packso that my  year old can act out captain hook being deviousi have attached a video so you can see the size and hear some of the sound effects my son uses jake to push down on the gold doubloon|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter loves adventure time and one of her favorite characters is lady rainicorn when i saw the plush lr at the toy store a few months ago i couldnt believe how huge she was compared to the others even more unbelievable was the low cost and that this was made by jazwares a company im not too fond with if youve seen their regular show toys youll understand why but they did a fantastic job bringing the adventure time cast to life more or less in plush formmeasuring a whopping  inches long lady rainicorn definitely stands out from the rest she looks just like her animated self on the show the only thing missing is a talking feature with an old man voice as with most plush made of this material throwing the lady in the washing machine if she gets dirty isnt a good idea just take a damp wash cloth to her and wipe down any spots despite the product being designed for kids ages  and up theres nothing here that would be a threat to younger children no plastic eyes no sharp parts come on the horn is fabric nothingif theres anything i personally dont like about this toy its that they could have stuffed her a little bit more every lady rainicorn ive seen in the store looks a bit flat i guess that makes sense given her design but she could use a little more in the head still this nitpick aside she would make a great addition to any adventure time fans collection|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|overall reviewthe dream townhouse is roomy spacious has beautiful color options beyond pink and white a nice blue hottub and middle section for example takes up little floor space by climbing the wall and has the dealbreaker for most kids the working elevator  but assemblers are advised to put in batteries and test all electronics flushing toilet crackling fireplace etc before assembling that is sadly a necessity for all modern barbie electronic toys since quality does vary greatlydeciding on a new home for barbiethe townhouse malibu dreamhouse beach house glam vacation house pink world house fashion fairytale palace lightup castle etc all offer something different for barbie  in particular the townhouse is a much better deal when compared to the malibu dreamhouse  for about  more barbie gets an elevator a lot more furniture and a house that takes up more wall space than floor space  as well the townhouse suits barbie scale much better than the malibu dreamhouse which can feel a bit crowded  the glam vacation house and pink world house dont have much in the way of ceilings or floors mostly just walls so girls dont really feel like they have a house  my  year old never really liked the pink house  it took up too much room in her floor and since it didnt have much of a floor furniture fell over constantly on carpet  as for the fairytale dvd movie houses they are built specifically for a character and regular barbies may seemfeel very out of place  the dream townhouse gives plenty of roominess for a variety of the more inexpensive barbies such as the fashionistas whose articulated arms and legs go well with the townhouseassembling the dream townhouseas noted above install batteries and check all electronics before assembling  mattel does have an assembly video that you can access as well   version dream townhouse to get an idea of how to put it together  but honestly it wasnt that hard  mattel has been smart and designed it such that you match up shapes to pieces and pieces all come in different widths so they wont snap into the wrong place  this was the same case with the monster high school playset and made sure that you assembled once and were done ikea has also gone this route thankfully  assembly ideally takes  minutes at most including taking out of the package  the graphics are setalready there thankfully so no annoying stickers to put togetherdurabilitythe houses of the past tended to be put together in roomsized pieces and so broke down fairly easily due to lack of a solid base  the dream townhouse comes with one solid  floor wall piece with folding permanently attached floors  this gives some durability to the house  once the floors are dropped it is held together by the thick columns on each level  the penthouse level then fits onto the second floor top  the elevator has a track and fortunately the new design means that sagging parts dont cause it to fall out as easily  the newer softer less brittle plastics of today often mean that the floors give a bit and this does cause the elevator to be a bit creaky and stiff especially compared to the dream houses with elevators from the s the softer plastics also seem to contribute to the variations in track sizes for the elevators  often requiring a bit of modification if your elevator doesnt work well or as designed but that said this is much better quality than the previous dream townhouseaestheticsits great to see barbie adding in more colors than pink or white though there was an odd yellow fold out house in the s  this townhouse has blue flooring in the middle and a large blue tub on top and there are some purples thrown in for variety plus many shades of pinks  dark to light  add interest  note that the color isnt as saturated as in the images on amazon so it isnt as eye wincingly bright  the house is a good scale for barbie and the dolls dont feel crowded though ken might be a bit tall for the middle level  as well it makes a beautiful display for barbies when not in playalternativesthis is the top of the line barbie house and is priced accordingly  keep in mind that there are other alternatives if you dont wantneed the barbie branding or would like a house not made of plastic  kidcraft has an excellent line of full wood with full color graphics doll houses that are priced comparably to this house  those doll houses are also barbiescale and ideal for a larger doll collection that may include moxie bratz etcsummaryin all this is an improvement and provides more value for money than the other barbie houses  quality variation issues keep this from being a  star product as well as the hefty price  the elevator doesnt always work well and the electronics especially may not all work|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|neca did an incredible job with this figure the detailing is extremely realistic if you rub your finger along the body it feels like rough wrinkled skin neca also managed to get quite a bit of articulation including wrist leg elbow shoulder and two neck joints one at the base and one near the head et is around  inches tall but hes a pretty bulky figure and looks quite largethe galactic friend figure comes with a wraparound towel the towel is moulded not cloth so you can really only dress et up in it one way however it looks great on him it can be removed to get a naked version of et one warning with the towel is that at a few points some of the white paint rubbed onto the figure i was initially pretty upset but i noticed that just rubbing those spots with a wet cloth completely removed the white paint and solved the problemthis figure also comes with a neck extension so you can make the neck longer it looks great although admittedly is a bit tough to get on you have to position the ball in the ball socket straight so you can push it in my advice is to just switch to the longer neck and leave itmy only complaint is that the small reeses pieces accessory doesnt have a label its just an orange bag of candy the trademark was probably left off for legal reasons still thats a pretty small complaintit took  years but finally we have an et figure worth of the film well worth the price|spam
A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|this figure is not very educationalas a fan of the video game contra for  the super  nintendo electronic system i knew that this update and  sequel gears of war for the sony playstation would be an exciting adventuresadly i never got the game to play on my ps but i did want the figure when i saw it in the storei came pretty close to not getting it when i saw it some kid in the store had put it in the basket to his wheelchair i followed him throughout the store hoping for a moment of distraction so i could take it from himafter all he did not have the years of appreciation for the game as i didin a moment of divine selection being delivered to me he had to go to the bathroom where he left his chair outside the stall it was there that i seized my figurei take a figure drawing class at the community center down the steet from my rent controlled medium supervision  apartment complex the figure seemed like a good idea to draw for an assignmentbut i ended up getting an f on it my instructor  mr liefeld felt that my anatomy balance and structure were poor demonstrations of any attempt to command the human figure in a convincing manner|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|unfortunately i found myself a bit disappointed with this figure id hoped neca would have updated its paint process for gizmo based on negative reviews of the earlier gizmo figure unfortunately this gizmo has some of the same paint smudges along the border between the white and brown fur its not too bad from far away but just looks sloppy up close the accessories are tiny and look fragile even worse they dont fit well in gizmos hands and i dont want to press them in for fear of breaking them overall this figure has potential but as it is i wouldnt recommend it for either kids or collectors|ham
A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|this figure has been a serious letdown for meit took some time for me to come to terms but now i can deal with the fact that the figure does not light up rather its  painted to appear lit up the price point for the size of the figure does not justify the simulated effectsome things you want simulated though i mean no one in their right mind wants real blood mold  mud slime or human hair on their action figures just the thought of smelling decomposition  alone should serve as a deterrentwith all that said this  is mr freeze and in lieu of the name he should be able to freezenot soi work at vegetarian meat packing plant and have access to an extremely cold freezer where we would store meat given that it goes unused except for times these greek guys will take people in there to  interview them i dont know about what but im supposed to keep my mouth shut if i know whats good for mewhen i got the figure in the mail i was pretty excited about it other than aforementioned lack of light up feature i did  plan on freezing it so it would be just the one in the gameso not to risk my job for misuse of company property i was able to find a hiding spot in the freezer next to some large zippered black bags about as tall as i am sometimes i think there might be people in them because of their bulky weight additionally they are padlocked whenever i do move the bags i am directed to put them in the trunks of peoples cars unlike the rest of the meat that we put in freezer trucksafter removing  the figure from the deep freeze i went to pose it so i could take some pictures of it to post of my cats and action figures blog but in so doing the figure managed to break into six pieces like a saltine cracker|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|weve been doing some early christmas shopping for our grandson and were really looking forward to doing a little prechristmas testing out of s twist  tumble cargo drop making its debut on the  collector checklist having been so delighted with another  now that its in front of us we wouldnt put it on the same level as dieselworks due to an immediately apparent mechanical glitch as well as the fact that theres only one place to connect it up to other sets or track compared to three on dieselworks  but grandma  grandpa were able to doctor it up to where its workable glad we found out ahead of time and were sure hell enjoy having its featured building the smelters where old engine parts are melted down as another place for his trains to visit  the  price free shipping seemed relatively reasonablethough not as bright as some of the other sets about twothirds of it is the mostly grey smelters shed and the grey scurvedinclined track it gets little punches of color here and there  paxton deep green with yellow lining black cab red base   black wheels and his yellow cargo car with  black wheels  both included  start out at the top of the smelters shed where you place his cargo of old train parts into a yellow lever scoop when you lift the lever it sends paxton and his car down and around the scurve incline while his cargo drops into a yellow cargo bucket midway through the curve paxton pushes through a yellow trip gate which triggers the bucket to drop the cargo down the goldishorange chute and into the matching smelting furnace paxton arrives at the bottom halted by a yellow stop gate to collect the supposedly now melted iron cargo the furnace has a grey door at the bottom that you lift up to release the cargo into paxtons car  pretty clever  the glitch was that the iron cargo which is colored orange we suppose because its supposed to be so hot its glowing is a hollow piece of lightweight plastic honestly its the cheapest thing weve seen in the tnp line unfortunately and not only is it too light to propel down the chute but on half of our attempts it actually just popped right out of the bucket and onto the floor  our solution was to pull a piece of silly putty mold it to the inside of the hollow area placing a piece of tape at the bottom so it wouldnt stick to the lever  waalaa  the cargo is now weighted enough that it tumbles down the chute and into the furnace as intended  other details are windows and fan vents on the shed through which you see the orangeyellow glow of fire a couple of green panels on the front of the shed the letters d and w near the top for diesel works maybe with a circular emblem in between depicting melted iron being poured and across from the cargo door theres a light brown panel that pops into the set to keep paxton from flying off the track and serves as a partition between the track and a rocky area where we guess paxton takes his lunch breaks  theres a passageway underneath the shed with enough width and height to run an additional piece of track through  we know our grandson will come up with clever ways to incorporate this into his island of sodor  were thinking this is where hell also keep iron arry and iron bert  it wouldve made sense to include them in this set since they work at the smelters but that would prevent us from having to purchase them separately now wouldnt it    maybe they have an overabundance of paxtons since hes also included in another  set   paxton at the blue mountain stone shedupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that fall into what ive come to categorize as an intermediate range of between  and they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds knapford station knapford holiday celebration sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop thomas treasure hunt adventure thomas shark exhibit paxton at the blue mountain stone shed and arctic exhibit  the great thing about these sets and those i categorize as basic with under  msrps is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets and even the intermediate sets relatively so and take them with us on excursionswe were first time grandparents of a   year old when my husband and i began a tnp collection for our grandson hoping hed pass it along to his own kids one day  weve all had a great time interacting with this overall quality line of trains vehicles and playsets  he turned  at the end of april and still enjoys spending a couple of hours of each day he spends with us in the sodor land of make believe that spans a large portion of our basement  although disneys cars characters are beginning to occupy a different portion its nice to see our investment continuing to hold his interest engaging and encouraging that active imagination  grandson  came along in march so we plan to continue collecting tnp for several years to come|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|like the yuuzhan vong figure that came with the  comic pack hasbro did an excellent job crafting and detailing this nom anor however the nom anor figure is overall a more accurate representation of the species the figure is smaller and the body proportions are less comicbookish also hasbro painted striking blue tatoos on his head the chest plate is painted a beautiful light brown with blue dots the only part that bothers us is the hands  the paint color doesnt quite match the yellowish skin tone on the face its not too blatant and really only becomes noticeable under bright lights still it does make us wonder if perhaps hasbro decided to repaint the head before release indeed the head on the final figure does look a bit different from the one in the prototype photosinterestingly the prototype figures we saw in early  depicted nom anor wearing a plastic cloak while the plastic cloak seemed to fit more snugly around his head were glad hasbro decided to go with the softgoods cloak we like the way it drapes behind him the cloak has a hole in the back so you can put his back spikes on over the cloak this looks great from the front although from behind it looks a bit odd then again according to the books the cloak is an organic lifeform so its possible it shapes itself around the spikes one thing we noticed is that if you remove the cloak and chest plate the figure looks more like a generic vong if you like the njo its worth getting multiple copies as vong army builders  frankly this is probably the closest hasbro will ever get to releasing a realistic generic yuuzhan vong figure|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the okapi has been a favorite animal of mine ever since i was in the fourth grade we had to write a report about a strange animal of our choice and i chose the okapi my teacher thought i made it up and gave me an f that same day i went to the library checked out a book on animals and shoved the page with the okapi in her face she gave me an a and ever since then i cant help but smirk and think of that event whenever i see the animal i have to say im jealous of my daughters new stuffed okapi now too we saw this little guy at our zoos gift shop and she fell in love instantly clutching him with both arms the whole time we were in there this is a very cute stuffed animal and pretty big too its crazy how cheap it is considering the sizethe okapi is about  inches tall and has all the features it needs to be recognized the only thing missing is the giraffe hornthingies but hey its a baby okapi here its a soft stuffed animal sure to make any child happy and makes for a perfect snuggling companion  it can even stand up without falling over always a plus in my bookmy one complaint is that the stitching isnt that great the one i ordered arrived with a big hole on one side of the face where the brown area above the nose meets the white area of the face stuffing was coming out and it was a big downer things like this can be fixed of course but you may want to check your zoos gift shop for one to check for any imperfections before ordering if you have the option its not just this one area that had poor stitching either i noticed a few parts along the stomach that felt a bit loose and will probably need to be reinforced soon as long as your kids arent rough with it the little okapi should be just finewild republic makes a ton of cool stuffed animals with my favorites being the honey badger hyena and giant pink giraffe well definitely be picking up more of these in the near future|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter was super pumped when she first saw pictures of venus mcflytrap a couple of months ago she loves the monster high dolls and has built up quite a collection in a small amount of time and now that shes started to ship weve been able to add her to the family something ive been saying about the last couple weve bought is that those ones really stand out from the others thanks to their colors and design well ms venus is yet another one of those truly unique in her color scheme and with a dazzling outfit to match its easy to see why shes the most popular of the new wave of dolls while i like the others venus is the one that pops out at you when you look at them on the shelf and hey shes even ecofriendlyvenus is on the standard mh doll body with all the usual points of articulation her headneck shoulders elbows wrists upper legs and knees can all be moved around she doesnt have any special features on her body like rochelle goyle does the vines on her legs are separate pieces of plastic and not molded to them the green gal also has a vine necklace vine bracelets and a vine earring on her left ear with green hoops on the right even her shoelaces seem to be vines the makeup she has is very stylish you also gotta love the lipstick which has some white designs to make it look like the teeth on a venus flytrap my favorite feature though is her hair pink with green streaks but the right side of her head is shaved and pure pink as far as i know this is the first female monster high doll to have any part of her head shaved it feels fuzzy and the color is bold very cool venus outfit consists of a denim vest with an eco punk patch black and neon colored shirt with a similar theme black skirt and neon tights her shoes are magenta with green teeth on the toes normally id think that sticking to a theme this much is overkill but they really did everything right with her design this doll is a hitaccessorywise venus comes with your usual monster high accessories a brush journal and stand and two that are new first is an ecofriendly tote bag this thing is a bit too small to be used for anything but you can fit super small objects in here if you want i like the ribcage print on it her other accessory is chewlian venus pet plant hes a cool pet featuring big fangs beady little eyes and a mohawk its good to see that as the monster high line continues they arent running out of ideas for new petsas usual be patient and youll be able to get her for the standard price or maybe a little less venus mcflytrap only recently started shipping so while she might be sold out just give it a little time the same thing happened with spectra rochelle and many others even then i wouldnt feel guilty spending a little more than retail for venus shes one of the best so far|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|finally we get a figure of darth malgus the primary public face of the new swtor mmo malgus has all of the beautiful articulation and paint of the newer vintage figures i absolutely love the head also the cloak has a thin wire around the neck allowing you to secure it on the figure so it rests pretty well on him the hood is a bit too big but its far better than any other hasbro efforts at including cloaks for figures  the only thing on this figure that could be improved are the joints between the legs and hips it would have been even better had hasbro made this a ball and socket joint but its not too bad overall i definitely recommend this figure especially for swtor fans although it might be worth waiting until prices die down i got mine for half the price offered currently on amazon|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|skeletal spearmen are one of those sculpts created to fill a wargaming niche  i have almost never found a skeleton with a spear in adventure usually because theyre packed together so tightly in a dungeon that spears are impractical you get three of david pughs sculpts which stand at attention with an interesting shield in one hand and a not interesting spear in the otherand thats pretty much all they do  stand there  no sense of movement  just spearmen waiting to be told what to do  theyd make great thugs for a necromancer but by themselves theyre not all that interesting  if you need undead troops these will fit the bill though|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|ive never quite understood the fijit toys i first saw them last year and didnt know what to make of it a cute colorful robot that makes semipainful robotic sounds and gyrates now this year the yippits have come out and im in the same spot all over again i think what bugs me the most about this toy is that the age range is supposed to be for kids  i cant think of many kids over the age of  or  that would get much out of these guys unless they just plain like cute robots the yippits toys dont do a whole lot and what you can do is more like a cute version of bop it or simonpatter here has a couple of different modes to play with first theres the random mode you get by pressing the left button on her head shell make random sounds and her eyes will light up patter can also perform tricks based on how many times you clap your hands you have to pay attention to her mouth though as it lights up with each clap that it recognizes clap  times and patter will play music and dance around clap  times and shell make one quick sound thats supposed to be begging yeah not too exciting so far huh but when you press and hold the right button on the top of her head the little robodog will play another music track that youre supposed to clap along to the beat withthe last two modes are patternbased press and hold both buttons on patters head to get her in the game mode then press either button to select which one you want pressing the left button gets you a game where youre supposed to copy what patter does if her right eye lights up press the right button if her mouth lights up clap as the game goes on shell want you to go in longer patterns like pressing both buttons at the same time clapping pressing another button once etc the other game isnt any betterbasically youre getting a spruced up version of simon and bop it here just in a cute little robot dog package personally i feel like theyre asking way too much for this thing especially considering that the new furby which does way more is around the same price why not just spend a few more bucks and go for that instead the yippits are wellmade and durable but it seems like they should be doing more than just a few tricks and playing a quick pattern game if you can get a good deal on this toy and your child is really into it then go for it if its one of those things theyre just mildly interested in just pass|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|at last years san diego comic con neca showed off tons of the gremlins figures that were going to be released over the course of  one of the figures that caught my attention was the lightning gremlin he really stood out thanks to his design and i couldnt wait to get him well here we are a year later and hes finally been released unfortunately the lightning gremlin is a single figure release and not part of a two pack this is easily the worst figure thats come out so far for several reasons that being said im still glad i picked it up but its still a big waste on necas part surprise surprisethe lightning gremlin looks exactly as he does in the stock picture he has no articulation at all and the only feature is the explosive base he can be removed from there arent any accessories either the clear blue plastic does look good as does the sculpt of the gremlin but good lord is this a shoddy release why not include him with the upcoming brown gremlin who doesnt really have anything that makes him stand out from the others the lightning gremlin could be his accessory and itd be a cool deal instead youre spending the same amount for what the other regular gremlins figures costand all of them have articulation more difficult sculpts accessories and are actual toys this is just a display piece that shouldnt cost more than a few bucksand you know what the kicker is the stand doesnt even work only a tiny bit of lightning gremlins lower body goes into it so the rest of the weight is in the top causing him to fall forward or back i have mine leaned against another figure because the plastic on this guy is so thin to make the electric appearance work well theres a good chance that itd break with one little fall be very careful when handling this figurei dont know if this is really a sdcc exclusive though it is exclusive to a certain big toy store here in the us that usually shoots the value up a little bit and yet i doubt this exclusive will net big bucks everstill if you plan on collecting all the gremlins youll need this guy and he does look cool with the others pay the retail price or less no more its not worth it|ham

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|hell hounds are pretty common beasts as sculpts but the definition seems their physiognomy varies from sculptor to sculptor are they actual hounds made of fire or big scarylooking dogs  sculptor ben siens opts for the more realistic approachthis hell hound is large which by dd terms means it will be a more dangerous foe than your typical hell hound it looks like a combination of a cat and a dog with a catlike tail and forepaws that seem catlike but doglike features  its entire back and cheeks are studded with bony protrusions and all along its spine is either actual flames or furi applied a metallic red color to the hell hounds skin and used reds and yellows for the fur  not quite flames but certainly not natural eitherthis hell hound has a muscular heavy feel to it that makes it look solidand yet its not particularly intimidating either  this is more a function of the monster than the sculpt  large hell hounds should be terrifying because of the size of this critter and the spikes on its back it looks like more like a dire wolf than a hell houndas a miniature in the reaper bones set its a nice complement to the other critters as a standalone figure that retails for seven bucks you can do better for cheaper|ham
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|first lets start with the bad newsit seems the packing from this seller was not done properly for delivery it came with a big cutter hole and it seemed like the box was under a pile of something  fortunately the ship inside was not damaged  so it gets one less star because of it  for me it is not really a problem as i wanted the ship but for a collector it is a turn off a friend of mine bought this toy in my behalf in december   i would have liked that the box was intact as i keep the boxes too  it is not just a problem of the packing at sellers delivery  y wing has a similar sized box and it uses cardboard box inside that makes the box quite sturdy  so blame hasbro toonow lets go for the reviewthis ship is about  cm long about  inches  it has some basic features cockpit always stays leveled as it rotates when you move the ship  it seems that it uses some sort of weight to make it turn  it is not perfect but still a cool feature wings can be extended and retracted by rotating one of the four engines it has it has a small handle to extend and retract landing gear wing cannons come in two versions one set that is movie accurate and one set that can fire small plastic projectiles  they can be exchanged easily cockpit canopy to fit a pilot insidei had some problems to fit a pilot inside  the room for pilot is so tight that i had to push the pilot a bit hard to make him fit inside or i would not be able to close the canopy  for such a big ship it was quite a tight room for a pilot  this is why it has another less star so it gets  starsif you see the movie prototype in the bluray edition you may notice that the paint scheme of the ship and a few details of the exterior of the ship are not  movie accurate like the japanese zero red circles it has in the toy however in the movie itself it is hard to see the details as they move fast or they are showed in the distance in motionif you see return of the jedi and you want to buy a pilot that has the helmet of bwing pilots you may need to either go for a pilot pack that has a b wing with white outfit or you may want to buy the awing pilot that comes with a bwing helmet but a green outfit  it seems very odd that they advertise b wing pilot as a pilot with a wing helmet and a red outfit while in the movie it should have white outfit and the helmet that comes with the a wing action figurebe advised that it may be hard to fit the pilot inside the fighter  this is not particular to bwing as also y wing has a tight cockpit that makes it hard to fit a pilot insidethe cockpit controls are very detailed very nicely detailed an applause to the sculptor but the panel behind the pilot isnt a minor drawback  and in general terms the ship has a very nice proportion that makes the overall look of the ship very movie accuratethe material of this ship is somehow sturdy for a collector but may not be sturdy enough for a kid  the ship looks far better flying than landed  so if you are going to have a display for it you better hang it instead of having it on a shelf|ham

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|this little toy is really pretty amazing especially for the price it is very thin and light which is just perfect for this age as most of the toys are bigger and bulky its actually a touch screen and the kids get that concept right away it sings and talks of course but what struck me most of all was that it is smartmy yearold was playing with it and it was asking her to touch a particular picture  blueberries or similar instead of touching the picture it was asking for she kept touching another picture the toy caught up with her after she did this  or  times and instead asked her to touch the picture she was already pressing over and over now it was clear she didnt understand what the toy was asking her to do so this change in tactics may have helped her to understand my yearold of course got the idea of the toy right away and was able to do the games hes out of the age range of this toy but it still kept him entertained for a few minutesi dont think weve even found everything that this little toy can do yet my yearold doesnt play with it for long periods of time but i think it might make a good travel toy because it is so light and easy to transport it doesnt seem flimsy but my kids are gentle with their toys for the most part so i cant speak to its durability yet especially with kids who are more physical|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|quick note before i begin the reviews for all  of the turtles combat gear packs seem to appear on all  pages here im reviewing michelangelos and ill mention the other  at the endmy daughter is on a big ninja turtles kick at the moment which i think is funny because it officially completes her liking all the things i liked at that age and i didnt force her to like any of them and believe it or not her favorite ninja turtle is the same i liked at the same age michelangelo seriously what are the odds  whenever wed pass the tmnt toys at the store this weapon set was something shed always point out and now that she has it she loves it it kind of surprised me too since she was enjoying the heck out of the foamcovered nunchaku i gave her a few years agoin this set you get two throwing star discs an orange bandana and one pair of nunchaku the nunchaku are made of a soft plastic and area hollow so theres practically no chance of anyone getting hurt if they get smacked by them the plastic chain lets them move surprisingly fast when swung as for the throwing star discs theyre made of plastic as well and can be thrown like little frisbees for maximum distance they soar with no problems at all the bandana is long enough to be tied around in the back just like the turtles do this could be a pain for your kids if they dont know how to tie things but hey it makes for good practice i like that they shaped it a little bit instead of having the bandana be one straight piece of fabric overall this set is an absolute steal at the price its going for im really surprised they arent charging double for itwith the other sets donatellos is the bo with two stars and the bandana leonardos one katana with the stars and bandana and raphs is two sai with the bandana while i could say the same thing with mikeys set for not including another pair of nunchaku i feel like they should have included the other katana with leos set you can always buy an extra to get the second katana as well as some extra stars the bo included with dons is pretty short and could have been put together with three pieces instead of two to make it a bit longer raphs set is awesome though and the sai look great im glad he got a good both weapons in his it just wouldnt be the same with one sai even without the throwing stars raphs set is greatthese ninja combat gear sets are an excellent toy for kids to have if they love the turtles wellmade pretty safe and most importantly fun hopefully a shredder set will be released some time so your little turtles can have a bad guy to go up against|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the schleich smurfs toys are great for kids and adults alike there are tons out there to collect and it seems like new ones get made on a regular basis still having a ton of little smurfs on your shelf to display looks great but how about you spruce things up a bit and give them a house well here you go the schleich smurfs house is a fantastic little home to store a couple of smurfs in or to just keep out as scenery its  inches tall when assembled and can store several figures inside yes a tiny bit of assembly is needed to put the house together though its not going to take you more than a few minutes to put the pieces in place the mushroom house is made of two main pieces and the rest are for the door windows and chimney everything stays together fairly well though a few pieces might fall off with regular use during playtime dont worry though as everything goes back together without any problems this is a pretty durable toythe included figures are papa smurf smurfette brainy smurf and  gargamel its no big deal but papa smurf is packaged by his own while the others are bundled together maybe he really is that much of a boss each figure looks like they should and i really dig papa smurfs sculpt and pose the inclusion of gargamel is a little puzzling though given his tiny size hes only slightly taller than the smurf figures and you know that isnt the case in the show maybe you can pretend he accidentally zapped himself with a shrinking spell or something either way kids with imagination shouldnt have any trouble coming up with some fun scenarios with him running around the smurf house none of the figures have any articulation since theyre onepiece pvc figures but theyre still fun the paint on everything is pretty good and looks a lot better than similar toys ive seen latelyteen titans figures im looking at youtheres nothing bad i can say about this house or the figures its durable fun and very much worth the price its selling for i just saw that they have a few other houses by schleich for your little smurf village so why not pick up a few others too my daughter loves the toys and im sure well have our own smurf village here very soon|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i dont know when it happened exactly but over the last year or so the bratz dolls seem to have been taken in a new direction trying to get back the top spot in the dolls market after monster high just obliterated the competition granted i never paid that much attention to dolls at all before my daughter was born though id see commercials of new ones here and there but a few months ago i thought i saw a new monster high doll with new packaging in the store and it ended up being a bratz doll a bratzillaz doll to be exact my daughter loves her mh dolls before any others though she thinks a few of these bratzillaz are cool too and cloetta spelletta here is one that she was interested in after putting it side by site with a mh doll i have to say that these new bratz are pretty much on par with mh in terms of quality and fun there are clear differences in the two that youll notice immediately too aside from the general design i know that this is not a monster high doll and im sorry to compare the two so much its just that there are such obvious similarities and i cant help itms cloetta stands at about  inches tall nearly perfectly inscale with the monster high dolls oddly enough she features a nicely articulated body and you can move her head shoulders elbows wrists waist hips and knees the hip articulation is slightly limited due to her outfit but not a big deal personally i think this body is better than the standard mh doll body because the limbs have a little more weight to them and arent as flimsy i notice a lot of loose joints with the mh doll shoulders and wrists drooping out of poses after a second i dont think thatll be as much of a problem with the bratzillaz cloetta also has glass eyes that look beautiful you cant see them too well in the stock images and if you havent seen one of these dolls in person yet youll be pleasantly surprised upon seeing her out of the box the hair is rooted perfectly too and feels the same as your average mh dollsas for her outfit cloetta has a plastic hat that fits on her head with a clear plastic band her dress has a weird feeling to it almost like a combination of leather and vinyl it looks good and has a plastic pearl necklace and chest piece over it her belt is white with pearls on it and has a medallion for the magic academy her silver and pink cape ties around at the neck with laces giving her a cape was a nice touch but i think it looks a bit cheap especially compared to the rest of the doll finally are her boots and earrings the boots slide on and off her feet easily and the earrings are secure enough to not worry about falling out if they do come out though you simply pop them back in again like a monster high dolls overall cloetta looks pretty dang cool with the outfit hair and pink skin and dont forget the witch mark symbol on the left part of her chestfinally are the accessories of which are a bit disappointing all cloetta comes with are her broom hair brush a stand and the spell scroll the stand does its job like it should the brush works like it should too and looks ok and the scroll will likely be forgotten after a day what bothers me the most about this isnt that she barely comes with anything but that they actually took the time to put in an image of cloettas pet barkthalameow in the packaging right next to her clearly in view why would you include an image of her pet why not just include the actual toy i cant say that this is the reason im not giving this toy a full  stars though it does hurt the score a little for being such a stupid greedy choicethat gripe aside bratzillaz are a nice addition to the spooky dolls category for young girls theyre pretty welldesigned and can be put into any monster high collection without looking off cloetta was my daughters first and weve gotten a few more since then im looking forward to seeing where this line goes|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|i bought space checkers on a whim because i found myself in a toy store with a fiveyearold  these are the compromises parents make if i was going to have to buy a toy i was determined that it would be a game we could both play fortunately space checkers turned out to be a surprisingly engaging game for adults and kids alikespace checkers features four alien races the ixithan empire little green men the kanaloan alliance yellow disembodied heads like tmnts kraang the mechanoid armada likewell palladiums mechanoids only blue and the formic commune like red dd formians  they are all theoretically battling for control of earththe board consists of  spaces divided into four quarters each aligned with a colorrace  there are starting spots for  colorcoded flying saucers as well as  spaces off the main board that act as prison cells for captured saucers  earth sits in the center taking up sixteen spaces it has no bearing on game play other than as an obstacle that must be avoided so much for battling for the supremacy of earththeres no kinging in space checkers so we invented that rule that whoever makes it to the opposite side becomes a supreme commander and can move in any direction from that point on  the official rules mitigate this somewhat by dictating that once youre on the opposite side of the board you can move wild and move in any direction without regard for the tyrannous color die see belowplayers roll two dice one that determines direction by color or wild and one that determines the number of moves  you can also warp across the board by simply moving off one side and starting across on the other side  in essence treating the board like a sphere rules otherwise progress as normal checkers  which is to say that theres almost no rules that apply from checkers because the board colors and number of players changes the game significantlyif space checkers has a flaw its the colorcoded die  the definition of moving towards a color is so vague that it causes quite a bit of confusion  do you have to move in a straight line does moving backwards and warping count as moving toward a color  can you just immediately attack another player on the opposite side by warping backwards a primer on how checkers works might help i thought i knew how to play checkers but reviewing the rules reminded me that the devil is in the detailsthis is my problem of course  my children were not bothered in the least by the lack of clarification on how space checkers work because they only just learned checkers the game has so far entertained my boy and my twoyearold girl for several days in a row high praise indeed for games that often dont last more than a few hours|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters been on a superhero kick for the last year or so and when i got a chance to get the spiderman stuntacular city playset i knew shed love it as soon as this thing arrived she was all over it any young fan of spiderman should have a blast playing with it though it would be a good idea to get some additional little marvel figures to go along with it since it only comes with spidermanfirst off this playset is huge when it was delivered the size of the shipping box had me wondering if something else was sent to me by mistake unpacking the toy is a little annoying so make sure you have scissors ready everything in here is tied down right down to spideys motorcycle even when i got the motorcycle out of the box there was still a tie around it that needed to be removed once free everythings ready to go batteries are included and work perfectly though its worth mentioning that these are regular demo batteries and will need to be replaced within a few weeks if the toys played with regularly the stuntacular city features a small rampslide for spideys bike to go down a lizard hand that when pulled down causes the window to break and reveal the lizards head some webs on the side for spiderman to hang around on a cool adjustable ledge that lets spiderman hang by his feet or stand up normally and finally a fancy climbing feature press a button on the front of the playset and as long as spidermans in the right spot hell climb up the building thanks to the magnets in him the stuntacular city has loud sound effects and music when you use this feature and the lizard window one something for parents who get easily annoyed by their kids toys for some reason to keep in mindthe first time we saw spiderman climb the wall both my daughter and i started laughing he makes this weird turn towards the top and moves in a bizarre way fun fact you can use similar toys with magnets in them and have them climb up as well like select littlest pet shop figures that adds a bit of life to this toy if you ask me watching a little skunk climb up a wall using its caboose the next big superhero possibly spidermans motorcycle is a nice addition though it can only go forward and back you cant steer it but kids probably wont mind when i had a chance to examine everything myself i couldnt find any features that might cause harm or any sharp pieces on the structure so its pretty safe the only thing to watch out for would be carefully cleaning it when it needs a little scrubbing and for what its worth a short story book is included that centers around doing the right thing its a cute additionthe things keeping it from being  stars arent too big yes the structure is a bit on the flimsy side and can easily break if youre not careful the opening window the webs on the side and even the switch couldve been made better my other gripe is the price when amazon finally showed how much this thing runs for i did a double take it doesnt seem like youre getting your moneys worth here and i swear ive seen similar playsets for half the cost then again this is a toy featuring one of the biggest names in comics ever so it makes sense that it costs moretwo weeks since getting it my daughter still regularly plays with the stuntacular city spiderman rides his motorcycle down the hall and around the living room doing his thing and ive read her the book that came with it several times its a good toy for the little superhero fan in your life|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|based on the review at jedi temple archive i was worried about this figure however i actually like it a lot the biggest problem is the neck joint  hasbro made a big hole at the base of jar jars neck so you can move it around but if the neck is pushed back you can see the hold fortunately ive found that if you push the neck forward it actually looks pretty good i love the detail on jar jars head and arms it would be great if hasbro produced a version without the hole in the neck but in the meantime this is the best version of that crazy gungan out there|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|in terms of aesthetics this is the best sandtrooper ever this figure looks dirty as if hes been stuck in a sandstorm which is precisely how he should look too many past sandtrooper figures have been too clean so this figure is a huge step forward unfortunately the dirty paint seems like it chips off a bit not too much but in a few spots on the armor look clean white and stick out under bright light its not a huge problem but id recommend carefully inspecting the figure before buying him to make sure youre happy with the paint job|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its hilarious that hasbro made a vader figure specific to the final scene in rotj generally hasbro did a good job the larger piece of electricity fits vader like a glove and looks really effective on him the smaller piece is harder to attach and falls off the vader figure itself is a repack of the rotj vintage vader however his skirt wraps around the front a bit too much covering his legs id recommend pushing it back to the sidesoverall a great figure for dioramas of the emperors throne room|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this character needed an update bespin leia has one of the most beautiful wardrobes of the entire star wars saga and hasbro did it justice with the silken clothes hasbro also got leias face right making her sufficiently feminine some of the earlier leia figures looked pretty masculine now we need to get an updated lando to flirt with her|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|a few weeks ago i made the comment to my daughter that abbey bominable seems to get all the most beautiful outfits seriously every single abbey that comes out is gorgeous and its becoming apparent that a lot of the other dolls arent getting much attention im not seeing very many cleo dolls any more or lagoona robecca operetta ghoulia or clawdeen clawdeen has always been one of my daughters favorites and while i think shes a cool character i havent been wowed by the different ones that have been releasedup until this onefor her birthday my daughter only wanted two monster high dolls the new festival abbey see and little dead riding wolf we missed out on her when she first came out last year and yet it seems a second wave of scarily ever after dolls has hit stores over the last couple of months as soon as i saw that she was available i ordered clawdeen and when i opened the shipping box i couldnt believe how beautiful she was she looked so plain in pictures of the three scarily ever after girls little dead riding wolf is definitely the winner in my book the bold red on her dress and cape make her a standout and they did excellent on her hair too if you havent seen this clawdeen in person yet and were on the fence about getting her rest assured that stock images dont do her justicelittle dead riding hood is on your standard monster high doll body articulation at the head shoulders elbows wrists upper legs knees and bootsfeet her boots are attached to the leg so you cant remove them from her feet clawdeen has a beautiful look with her makeup featuring a couple shades of purple glitter and red lipstick simply put this is a pretty basic yet gorgeous clawdeen that could pull off some other outfits very well her dress here is nothing short of striking the red hood has a velvety feel to it with a a nice spot pattern on the inside of the cape theres a small clasp at the neck that secures simply and holds together like it should my daughter hasnt said anything about it not staying closed and i have the doll right here as im reviewing it just be careful with this piece and it should be ok it is a small plastic clasp and could wear down over time if its opened and closed repeatedly ldrhs dress has a corset design on top with black and purple laces going down and little golden crossbones at the waist there are even little gold buckles at the bottom of each purple ribbon all around the dress this is a very nice touch and im surprised they didnt just use two for the front and ignore the rest the dress can be taken off easily thanks to the usual velcro back under the red dress skit portion is a black tulle helping it stick out and give it some more shape i also really dig the purple boots although she has trouble standing up because of the weight of the dress and youll probably have to use the stand if you want to display her her only extra accessories for clothing include her earrings and a single purple and black arm warmerfinally shes a little light when it comes to accessories but she still comes with a few things ldrh has the usual monster high brush stand a story book and a little black coffin purse the story is great just like the others in this line with some nice illustrations the purse again is black and not purple like it is in the stock image above if you ask me the black goes with her outfit betterif clawdeen an often overlooked doll as of late can look this great when given the storybook treatment i can only imagine how abbey skelita and venus can be if scarily ever after continues little dead riding wolf is a keeper buy her now before shes discontinued|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter must just be great at picking out the coolest dolls because it seems like any time she gets a new one i have a hard time giving it anything less than  stars on here spectra abbey venus jinafirethe list goes on and the ones that she doesnt like im usually right there with her agreeing that theyre either boring or dont have a whole lot going on for them however recently with the scaris dolls the one that stood out the most to me was skelita calaveras this probably has to do with me loving the art that dia de los muertos brings and when i saw skelita on the back of jinafires box i immediately asked my daughter you want to get her too right amazingly she didnt a few weeks ago i got a surprise when i woke up and there she was skelita now look i dont collect these dolls and ive basically stopped collecting toys to focus on other things but man was i happy when i got her seeing the doll inperson is great and its awesome to see a truly new monster high doll spectra may have the cool semitransparent limbs going on but skelita features something none of the others have a completely new bodyfirst things first skelitas unique skeleton body if you were ever wondering about the skeletal structure of the mh girls nows your chance to see how it looks the arms legs and torso are all completely new if theres a previous skeleton doll please correct me and all of the bones look great i especially love the hands and work on her back lift skelitas hair and youll see her spinal cord as well as the rib cage it may be a little gross as my daughter puts it but i love how unique it makes her the torso is contained within a clear plastic shell in the shape of your standard mh girl to help keep the clothing on as for the arms and legs they were very stiff at first and i was worried that they might break easier than usual given the new structure just be careful and dont move things too fast or hard and she should be fine as much as i would have liked to see them go all out and give her a skull with features painted on im glad they kept her head normalwith skin this is one of the head types that doesnt have ears thoughnow for her beautiful outfit skelita has a an orange necklace brown bracelet on her left wrist brown belt with skulls and flowers on it green summer shoes and the stunning black dress with colorful removable skirt the black dress is basic and stops right about where her skirt ends it has a grey flower and vine design on it and an open back showing off her bones her skirt is three layers with multiple colors and more flowers on them she may be as dead as it gets but skelitas outfit is full of life since her head type doesnt have ears there are no earrings my absolute favorite aspect of the doll aside from the skeleton body is how they painted her face just zoom in on the pictures above and see how beautifully everything comes together the dots the eyebrows the stitches this is one fantastic looking doll toys like this make me wonder why i was paying so much more for the living dead dolls years ago when they usually lacked this much creativity and fun as the line went on finally theres the hair ive yet to see a skelita with hair as straight as the stock pictures is and i havent seen one that looks as messy as the boxed picture above mines straight for the most part though the sides are curled at the ends it looks good and im happy with everything about my dollthe lack of accessories irks me a little as im used to seeing these dolls come with a pet when they make their debut it looks like the scaris collection skimps out on this as even the other new doll jinafire didnt come with a pet either im curious to see what they could have come up with for skelitas pet since jinafires potential pet is kind of obvious skelita does get a suitcase with wheels though it looks nice like the others and has a nice skeleton handle and a skull on the case she also comes with the usual brush stand and journalwhat more can i say to convince you that this is one of the best monster high dolls yet just a few months ago i said i was eagerly waiting to see what new characters they could come up with and they sure as heck didnt disappoint me while i dont collect toys any more i might make an exception and collect whatever variations of skelita that may come out if the basic doll looks this good who knows what the sweet  and others will look|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter has wanted draculauras car for over a year now yet she always ends up getting a new monster high doll instead for one reason or another we hadnt seen the scaris convertible in stores but when i showed her a picture of it on here she quickly decided that she wanted this one too luckily for us i managed to get one and shes been very happy with it any monster high fan out there who wants something for their dolls to look even cooler with the scaris car definitely gets the job donethe convertible is surprisingly big made of a pretty durable plastic and can seat up to  monster high dolls two in the front and two in the back seat pop open the trunk and you can store a couple of accessories in there everything works like it should like the seat belts easily being pulled out to get dolls in the seats as well as the steering wheel and stick shift the cars design is pretty dang sweet with cobweblike patterns all over it and dog heads on the back lights theres even a scaris license plate while there isnt much variety in the colors they did make sure to add some little mh details like the steering wheel and stick shift fitting the theme check out the rims too i can just see my daughter wanting those for her car in  years when she starts drivingno accessories of any kind are included with this car and there arent any special light up or sound features either on the plus side this means no having to replace batteries when the features stop working though it would have been nice for them to include something even if its just the headlights or a horn sound feature you push the car forward and back to make it go with no pullback action of any sort its a pretty basic carthere are a few reasons why i give the car four stars the price the very limited trunk space a slight safety concern in theory nothing hazardous to kids and the lack of doors the price even when buying directly from amazon is a few bucks more than i think its worth youre getting a basic car with nothing extra no stickers not even a single solitary accessory like a booklet that most of the dolls come with a little photo album with the mh girls touring scaris would have been a pretty cool extra to throw in regarding the trunkif you notice the gaps in the sides of the car youll see that theres quite a bit of extra room that could have been used by the trunk this thing isnt even a half inch deep and can only hold the smallest of mh accessories not that id suggest putting pets in a trunk but even fitting say chewlian isnt going to happen very lame the lack of doors isnt that big of a deal since the dolls can be placed into the car easily but why not include doors that open and close as for that safety concern thats why i have the educational value rating at  stars you know how i said you can get two other dolls into the back seat well said seat is actually on the trunk imagine flattening the back of a vw beetle into a seat and slapping two seat belts on it so the passengers are sitting on the outside exposed to traffic yeah not really a good idea is it im not going to write a letter to congress about getting this toy pulled from stores because of this or anything but it makes me wonder what the heck they were thinking with this aspect of the design i wonder if the car will ever make an appearance in the mh show or movies exactly as it appears in toyformif you can get the car for a few bucks off during a sale or something more power to you my daughter loves playing with it which is priceless in my book so im happy with it too hopefully with the next vehicles that come out therell be a little more to make it worth your money|spam
A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|as a selfprofessed professional gamer easily i put in anywhere up to eighteen hours a day video games it is something that i enjoy and feel it is my way of helping out the gaming industry and community by investing so much time playing the games by myself or online with many strangers who often have become some of my best efriendswithout going into too much detail my marriage ended a few years ago she seemed pretty upset that i had invested so much time into gaming while not providing for the home somehow she never understood the big picture as to why i do what i doalthough i may never understand the timing of how it was possible but we did have a child together she is a few years old now and i try to be a good father for her birthday last week i thought that it would be a great idea to introduce her to the wonderful world of video games through action figures with the bright enticing colors of orange it would be something that she could be drawn to moresoall the ex inlaws and cousins were present for her birthday party bbq being italian i brought lassagna and red bull for the kids as an appetizer my ex brotherinlaw was pretty upset that the hyper kids were not hungry for the grilled food he had prepared i had to explain to him that kids metabolisms are different and will settle down to eat when they are readyhaving an online tournament i had to be at it was expedient that the gift opening take place and that my little girl open my present to her first so i could cut out early the packaging on the figure was pretty difficult open so i helped her with the box cutter knife i got for her back at eastereveryone was pretty upset that i got her that figure given that i did not stay for the entire party one or two others might of gotten her the same gift but i never include a gift receipt so people have to keep the gifts i give them my little angel was thrilled with the figure moreso the head crab that it came with since she kept putting it in her mouth|ham

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|i usually make my own play clay and give the kids kitchen implements to play with so this is not a typical toy for our house when i got it out of the box my daughter went nuts for it i could barely get it to the table and put it togetherit took me a few minutes to realize how to use it so reading the directions is helpful the set is a castle and all  sides are used to interact with the playdoh three of the sides contain princesses you can use the bottoms of the princess dolls to mold little items that they can hold or you can put the princess in the big mold and create a playdoh dress for them bonus the princesses can just be played with without the rest of the kit or the playdohthe th side of the castle is used to mold a prince out of playdoh now this is full of all sorts of symbolism really making a man but that is probably lost on the children my daughter just kept taking his head off and then requesting that i make another onethe top of the castle is used to make hair for rapunzel or anyone really this works much the same as all the other sets that make spaghetti or bacon or hair yes that means that dried bits stay in there and need to get pushed out the next time you use the seti have one quibble well two quibbles actually the first is the placement of the prince mold it blocks some of the other little molds on the castle in fact i took it apart and tried to put it together in a different way because i thought id done it wrong the first time are little fingers able to use those molds maybe but even my yearold has trouble using the little molds so they usually ask me to make those smaller more delicate pieces the castle sides also fall off easily they should come off fairly easily in order to use the castle but you cant really pick up the kit and move it without one of them falling off a big rubber band around it should solve the problemthe second quibble is that while this set and anything like it is good for creativity and smallmuscle development its not what i would consider educational kids will love any playdoh set like i said play clay and forks work just fine too so the princess theme is a bit of a turnoff for me my daughter does not have any other princess items so there wasnt a recognition factor for her  she just loves to play with it because its fun|spam

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|riding my scooter to the drivein movie theather and setting up a picnic blanket here in wisconson has always been a delightful ritual of mine over the years however with the cold weather this winter i have backed off a bit last weekend i was able to enjoy seeing the movie wreckit ralph at the drivein one of the things that most impressed me was his heros duty suit that ralph wore at one point in the movie it was a nice tribute to video game classics likes of galaga and metroidas it started to snow that night i decided to leave the movie early pack my picnic back onto the scooter and head over to target in hopes of finding a heros duty ralph figure gratefully the drivein theather management was kind enough to give me a partial refund for my ticket due to the snowwhen i got to target i headed straight over to the toy aisle i know my way around the store pretty good since i visit it at least twice a day looking for hot wheel treasure huntsright as i turned the corner to go down the aisle i immediately saw the heros duty ralph figure unfortunately there was this kid in a motorized wheelchair with basket in what appeared to be his grandparents blocking the aisle preventing me to get the figure so i had to walk around the aisle and reenter from the other side slightly irritated by that i made haste to get me figure as soon as i went for it the kid pointed at it for his grandpa grab it just before i was able to get to it i fell seconds to inches short of obtaining my prizei became more angry at this further inconvienencethe kid seemed pretty excited about the figure but didnt know exactly why ralph was wearing that suit instead of the familiar overalls obviously he had not seen the movie yet and thus should not own the figure the grandpa showed the figure to the grandma as they tried to determine its price unable to see the price the grandpa left figure in the basket with the kid in search of assistance from a target employee the grandma stood by impatiently until she followed after the grandpaas if it was divine providence the kid and the figure were left unattendedi seized the opportunity and took the figure from the kids basket and ran out towards the check out aisle of the storerunning past a store employee i heard security called on the employees radionot willing to risk spending the next six hours in the lossprevention office again at target i threw the figure into the garden center now decked out with holiday junk and left the storewhen i got home and still empty handed i decided to pay a bit extra and order the figure online|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the ninja turtles were one of my two favorite kinds of toys when i was little the other being ghostbusters and my daughter has taken after me and is a huge fan of the new show too its funny how that works out  years later something big when i was a kid coming back and being big when shes a kid not too long ago she lucked out and got most of the toys in the first wave with the four turtles being part of the haul the guys always came with cool extras when the first tmnt line of toys came out and that trend continues two decades later im reviewing donatello first because come on hes probably the most neglected of the four turtles what kid wants to be the guy with a stick while the others have all the cooler weaponsdonatello is the tallest turtle even in toyform being slightly taller than raph and leo i think its cool that they went the extra mile on height differences here as most companies would just use the same bodies when theyre so similar in design the articulation on this figure is excellent and you can move his head shoulders elbows wrists upper legs and knees this is a lot more than we got when i was little thats for sure the articulation is second only to the great comicbased tmnt figures that neca put out a few years ago all the work on don is great the colors are perfect details like bumps on his legs and dents in his shell are there and they even painted the little ring on the strap of his bo holster for a toy at this price they didnt skimp out on the figures in any way they only thing that might throw fans off is the lack of pupilsdon can hold his weapons with both hands which are sculpted in a holding position and when it comes to weapons he comes with quite a few extras the main ones worth mentioning are a chinese sectional staff sanjiegun and a bladed staff naginata he comes with a few smaller weapons as well just like the other turtles the bo and naginata can fit in his holster easily and not slip out it looks pretty cool to have him holding one and keeping the other aside as backup as usual the weapons are all painted brown but feature as much detail as his standard bo again these are a big step up from the old toys while still keeping with the style of the original releasesthese toys have been out for a while now and if you havent gotten them yet or were on the fence about getting them for your kids or even yourself i mean it when i say that these are some of the best action figures out today theyre fun to collect and play with and my daughter always has the turtles going on adventures in the sewer playset where shredder has mousers take littlest pet shop pets hostage i cant wait to start getting her more bad guys and some of the weird creatures like michelangelos squirrel|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|i have a feeling that april is that figure from the first wave of the new tmnt toys you know the one you get after youve gotten all the cool characters and your favorites unless april is your favorite anyway poor april got the short end of the stick as a figure compared to everyone else but being a key character in the show its cool that they included her with the first wave instead of throwing her in somewhere down the road plus its always great to have a girl in a mostlydude show face it even in the old tmnt cartoon there werent a lot of ladies especially ones that got the action figure treatment apparently april was also packed just one per case making her a bit rare when the figures first came out nearly two years later i see her in stores now and then about as much as i see splinteras far as the sculpt goes this looks just like ms april shes got the big boots the long sleeve shirt black leggings the spunky hair style everything i also love the  on her shirt which is a little tribute to the news station she worked for in the old cartoon she fits in perfectly with the turtles scalewise and sports a decent paint job i think they couldve done a little better on the mouth and eyes but its to be expected when i think back to the first april figure that came out for the first cartoon i remember all she really had was a camera this one she comes with a whole arsenal of weapons yep she comes with a large set of brown extra weapons just like the turtles do giving her a decent assortment of things to hold and join in on the action the most notable and probably everyones goto weapon for this toy is the training sword it fits in her hand perfectly though her hands do have pretty loose holding positionswhat hurts aprils score is the articulation all she can move is her arms legs and head giving her a whopping  points of articulation granted she doesnt need as much as the turtles or some of the villains but anything extra helps especially if youre going to be using her with any of the vehicles shes really reduced to a basic figure for the linei had a hard time deciding on if this is a  or  star figure shes definitely not a  some extra articulation wouldve bumped her up without question the reason im giving her an above average rating is because she does come with some weapons look at a few other figures in this line who even if they are more detailed and bigger dont come with anything at all and feature similar articulation they couldve not included anything at all as it is aprils a welcome addition to the line and my daughter has a blast having april bring the pain on leonardo and raphael on a regular basis for disturbing her littlest pet shop picnicswhat you didnt know theyre in the same universe|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|of all the presents my daughter got for her birthday last month it was the furby that got the most attention i was surprised at first because it was one of those toys that shed mention now and then not expressing a whole lot of interest in well here we are almost a month and a half later and shes playing with her furby regularly and always brings him along for trips i have to admit this is a pretty cool toy its leaps and bounds ahead of the original model and does so much more if this were around when i was a kid itd easily be one of my favorite toysfor starters the new furby has a better body model than the original instead of just moving its ears up and down this new one can move its head to give it more personality in its actions furby can dance along to music changing how it dances to different genres the most notable difference however is the led eyes all sorts of expressions are visible in the eyes now including some wacky icons like cows and dogs that show up depending on what the furby is doing the more you talk to furby the more english hell pick up after about two weeks we noticed a big difference in how he was talking and singing the big surprise though was seeing that there are different personalities it can have from crazy to evil to valley girl or is that just evil  the new furby is full of surprises different personality types come and go and if you dont like one you can always just reset it to go back to normal if youve owned a furby before you can expect everything that made that toy fun and much more this time around all the furbish the singing interacting with other furbies going to sleep when its not being played withhasbro took what was worked with the original and kept those features only making improvements another big selling point is the furby app download the app and you can feed the furby all kinds of things getting different reactions out of itim keeping the details about what we like about the new furby brief because theres still so much thats undiscovered just when you think youve seen everything a new personality comes out or it will sing along with a song that i wouldnt have expected it to this is definitely a five star toy in the fun category but there are just a few small things holding it back from getting  stars overall first it takes  aa batteries just like how the old furbies sucked the life out of theirs you can expect the new furby to go through batteries in no time if its played with regularly get rechargeables when you buy one and youll be set the other problem is a minor gripe of mine and its that the motor sound when it opens its mouth sounds almost as loud as the original furbys im no toy designer but arent we past noises like this it kind of distracts from the cute and cuddly nature of the little creature hearing mechanical sounds from inside every time it moves the only other problem is a temporary one it keeps selling out just be patient and youll find one on here or in stores honestly im surprised the new furby has managed to become nearly as popular as the first modelany child thats interested in the furby based on what theyve seen in commercials is going to absolutely love playing with it furby is still cute fun to play with and will likely be one of those toys that your kids remember when theyve grown up|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|amazon originally listed this right at fisherprices summer   msrp but in our original  review we stated it looked really flimsy and that grandpa  i would wait to see if it came down in price before adding it to the takenplay collection we started for our grandson the year it came out   when it went down to  we went ahead and purchased it hoping to be pleasantly surprised  suffice it to say  we werentweve noticed fp taking shortcuts and cheapening various aspects of this product line especially over the past year or so but in our opinion this is positively the worst product theyve put out  first of all they create an item for two trains to race down but only include one train luring the customer to purchase another train separately  while this wasnt an issue for us personally weve collected every train theyve manufactured for our grandson let us assure you that not only is it as flimsy as it looked it doesnt even operate as stated  youre supposed to be able to put  trains in the starting tray adjust the yellow switch gates to the desired lane track lift the starting tray and see who reaches the finish line designated by two blue flags first  flags are attached to a piece of track that can be connected to additional takenplay track or playsets you purchase separately  we attempted this with percy and thomas fifty times and not once did both of them even make it past the switch gates  one or both always got stuck on one of the switch gates  it makes you wonder whether the designers at fp have been given carte blanche control over what the company puts out without any oversight or review committee  by the way we ordered it on  here it is just  days later and amazon must be getting a slew of complaints and returns because theyve already dropped the price down to  less than fps msrp for their simple track packs  that was a smart decision because you cant claim somethings a playset when you cant play with it as describedyes it does close up to takenplay with percy snaps into the support piece underneath the rd section of track but we are quite certain that our grandson will have no interest in taking this anywhere  when youve really believed in a product line and invested so much money into it its a sad day when you see proof of its decline in such an extraordinary way  wed felt that wed be collecting this line for many years to come the grandson we started it for is now  but he has a  year old brother wholl be growing into the products soon and wed planned to continue purchasing as long as interest was maintained but it looks like the four years it took for them to go from a quality product line to this point will be the extent of our collection  shame on fisherprice for letting what started out as a great line go downhill so quickly and dramaticallyupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that have msrps of under   they are in order of introduction  the original version of the toteatrain playbox colin at the wharf thomas at the farm percys mail delivery tidmouth tunnel toby at trotters farm sir handel at great waterton sodor engine wash talking diesels fuel  freight delivery sodor paint shop around the rails with thomas muddy adventure go go speedy railway skip it sodor lumber company treasure tracks a new version of the toteatrain playbox skip this too and brendam docks  the beauty of these tnp playsets is that he can choose one to easily disconnect from the others fold up and take with us on excursions  theyre definitely the simplest to take n play with|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our grandsons been mesmerized by sharks since a visit to newport aquarium across the river from cincy on his nd birthday so this set  featuring the sodor aquariums shark exhibit  was a definite hit with him on his th  couple that with his maintaining an interest in the thomas collection we started years ago as well as amazons price of  coming in right at fisherprices summer  msrp of  and it made this purchase a given  the folks at fisherprice really got creative with this one  its another sturdy colorful set blue  gold with the usual grey track and depictions of various sea life in different places with  points where it can be connected up to additional track or other sets  thomas included starts out at the top by entering the sharks large mouth we adults might wonder how he gets up there but im sure little ones will have no trouble pretending harold hoisted him up  when you lift the handle at the back of the sharks head which is also the carrying handle thomas races down and that top track collapses down onto a raised piece of track so that thomas zooms backward into an enclosure that stops him  he can then chug out onto a circular piece of track to collect his load  a little blue rubberish feeling shark in a cargo car  when thomas goes down the track it releases the shark into the cargo car  now this is a different cargo car than those in other playsets its completely plastic and its wheels dont move  you have to insert thomas metal magnet connector into it so its actually raised off the track somewhat as thomas pulls it  very odd  unfortunately we see it as a sign of fp cutting corners which is disappointing  another disappointment is that  contrary to what the photo on the front of the box shows and despite the instructions that say thomas can ride over and attach to the cargo car and transport the shark to his destination there is no short grey piece of track for the cargo car to sit on underneath the picture of the large tank to await the release of the shark or thomas arrival the cargo car is simply placed underneath the tank on the ground and must be manually lifted off of the ground to place onto thomas the closest he gets to it is on the circular track  a more accurate photo is the one on the back of the box  despite those couple of disappointments our grandson was thrilled with the whole shark theme  later on we purchased targets lion  canyon and percys penguin adventure sets  he connects them all up and pretends its sodor zooupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that fall into what ive come to categorize as an intermediate range of between  and they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds knapford station knapford holiday celebration sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop thomas treasure hunt adventure thomas shark exhibit paxton at the blue mountain stone shed and arctic exhibit  the great thing about these sets and those i categorize as basic with under  msrps is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets and even the intermediate sets relatively so and take them with us on excursionsgrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  although recently weve seen a few signs that fp may be cheapening the line using more plastic instead of metal eliminating the chugging sounds of the talking engines as they move along the track etc well keep collecting them as long as he still shows an interest  hell be  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement with his little brother turning  in march it wont be long before hes playing with them too so were likely to be collecting for several years to come  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters favorite show right now is adventure time and upon seeing all the new stuffed characters at the toy store recently this was the one she liked the most i gotta admit jazwares has disappointed me a lot over the years especially recently with the regular show goods but these adventure time plush characters are some of the best smaller plush ive seen in recent memory id put these guys right up there with the mini pokemon that jakks pacific used to make i picked up this sleepy finn as a stocking stuffer since hes the perfect sizefinn stands at about  inches tall and is very wellmade the arms and legs are filled just right not too thin or too stuffed finns eyes and mouth are sewn in and all the areas where the colors change look great i know its a basic toy in design but they couldve done a lazy job on making these and its good to see that they didnt a pillow jake is attached to his left hand and is stuck to finns stomach this pillow is more of a basic cotton shirtlike material with jakes face printed on showing his signature smilethe key feature on this plush is the booty flap on finns back yep just like the real pajamas these ones feature a flap on the back that snaps shut open it up and finns caboose is revealed i didnt expect that on this little toy well done jazwares the buttons snap easily and feel sturdy so theres little chance of these breaking the only thing to watch out for with this toy is the pillow if you pull it too hard itll probably create a huge hole in poor finns stomach also be careful with jakes face since its printed on its likely going to fade with enough smooshing and squeezingif you pay the original price for this guy its a great deal i can see all of these adventure time plushes selling out soon since the shows gotten even bigger if only those regular show ones looked even half this good|spam

A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|she does not look like a female punk but like a male zombieher hips and waist is what makes the differenceher head is horribly sculpted and her fingers are very longshe comes with a suitcase with light sabers and a rifle and gunsit is not really an action figure you may want among your favorites only for the sake of having clone wars bounty hunters|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to like about this figure hasbro seems to have put a lot more thought and care into making him than it does with the regular stormtroopers and clone troopers which often have rubbery and yellowing helmets this republic trooper from the tor mmo is generally an excellent figure the articulation feels very smooth and natural including not just waist articulation but also a swivel chest his armor looks like it has multiple layers of bandoliers shoulder pads and other gear mostly due to hasbros excellent decision to make these separate accessories rather than part of the body moldhowever the figure is a bit frustrating because he cant hold his big gatling gun as naturally as id like you have to bend the handles of the gun a bit so they fit in his hand its not a bit deal but given that the characters most prominent scene features him with his gatling gun i wish hasbro had found a better solution balljointed wrists might have helped|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|when hasbro announced that it was going to make a realistic version of the clone wars obiwan i was skeptical the cw obiwan actually looks quite different from the film version especially with the clonetrooper gear however i think hasbro managed to make this character look both realistic and give it a slightly more cartoonish feel  a perfect mix of cw and prequel the head sculpt is new not just a reused one from the other vintage kenobi figures the bodys also all new overall im really beginning to like the realistic clone wars line|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|coming on the heels of hasbros ewok pack and twopack we get yet another excellent ewok lumat isnt a new body sculpt and hes somewhat generic for an ewok although the face is new what is really exciting about this little guy is the accessories his spear is new and looks really authentic also his bow can actually hold an arrow making it look like lumat is going to fire it the figure has shoulder elbow wrist and leg articulation which is amazing given how small he is overall hasbro has really nailed the ewoks down|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|along with the ewoks jabbas skiff guards have been the biggest winners in hasbros vintage line the weequay hunter came out in the power of the force line in the late s and while that was an excellent figure it needed an update with more articulation hasbro delivered and it looks great the face sculpt is even different from the weequay skiff captain figure that came out last year really not much more to say except to congratulate hasbro on such fine figures from this scene over the past few years|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|the  royal guard figure from the episode ii line actually works pretty well with its plastic cape but collectors have long wanted a version with cloth cape hasbro finally delivers the fabric used for the robes is a bit on the thick side but not so much so they drape nicely over the figures body and allow the helmet to rest comfortably on his head and shoulders even better if you remove the helmet and robes you get the main character from the crimson empire comics kir kanos i love how hasbro incorporated two separate characters into one figure not only does it give collectors an excuse to buy two of them but its also a neat way to get more expanded universe characters into the line|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|its been over  years since we got a nien nunb figure or at least nunb as he appeared in the cockpit of the falcon its actually pretty amazing since this guy is the one who saved the entire rebel fleet at endorregardless hasbro finally did nien nunb justice the figure comes with all the standard articulation weve come to expect from the vintage line what i really love about this figure though is the face hasbro did a great job giving it a more textured look with different shades of skin tones it looks a lot more realistic than the moviesnien nunb comes with a gun but i dont get why he also comes with a rifle it doesnt really fit in his hands for such an important figure i just wish hasbro could have given him something more appropriate maybe like a datapad|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i remember during the power of the force line being very impressed with hasbros take on prine face it was so good i didnt even think he needed much of an update over a dozen years later hasbro decided to revisit this character and did an even better job prune faces cloak sits on his head and shoulders perfectly like major panno he comes with a doublebarrel gun and comlink prune face also comes with his classic rifle although the tip seems to have gotten a bit bent in the packaging  nothing that cant be fixed though this figure is definitely a must for rotj fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|when hasbro announced that it was going to make a realistic version of the clone wars ahsoka i was skeptical and excited after all ahsoka as the breakout star of cw had never been depicted in realistic form however i think hasbro managed to make this character look both realistic and give it a slightly cartoonish feel  a perfect mix of cw and prequel styles overall im really beginning to like the realistic clone wars line|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|regular show became one of my favorite shows ever as soon as i watched my first episode all of the characters had me laughing out loud as did the wacky plots the one character that stood out the most to me though was skips a big yeti with tiny little legs who skips instead of walking like the others of course when you find out why he skips its kinda heartbreaking i held off on getting any of the other regular show plush characters because i wanted to get him first a good friend of mine got him for me a few weeks ago and this guy just plain rules i may have issues with how cracked out mordecai and rigby look in plushform but skips looks absolutely perfect its no wonder hes the only one thats constantly sold out in stores whenever i check out the regular show stuffskips stands at about  inches tall and appears exactly as he does in the stock image above some sites show him looking brighter and more yellow though its probably due to lighting his face abs and nips are sewn in and theres string separating the toes and fingers the hair around his head is a single piece of fabric and it looks pretty good as it is his arms and body are stuffed perfectly to give him that hulking appearance as for his legs theyre so little i laughed when i first saw them and how they dangle if you move skips around what else can i say the dude looks great my only little gripe is that the legs are put on the front of his body instead of in the middle and he looks weird if viewed from the side but its nothing bigive yet to see skips in the store myself all the others are available on a regular basis so i dont know if hes that popular or maybe hes the one that they have less of in shipments any fan of the show needs skips hopefully they make a bigger one with a talking feature somewhere down the road|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|there are some miniatures that you can never have enough of giant rats the type that are the size of a small child are common dungeon monsters that appear in increasingly large numbers the better to keep up with higher level adventurers  sandra garritys rat sculpts fill this niche nicely with rats in three different positions theres just one problem theyre awfully cute for giant ratsdungeons  dragons has evolved its thinking on the giant rat  someone decided in third edition that its not enough to make an animal giant but rather to make it dire  presumably this is to keep them from being confused with their reallife counterparts and giving game designers the freedom to make the animals as crazy as they want  but back in the day spiders and rats were just giant  even if comparatively they werent very largeso thus we have these rats  theyre large but theyre not particularly intimidating compare them to some of the painted miniatures in wizards of the coasts dungeons  dragons miniatures line and theyre positively adorablebut for volume and price theyre hard to beat  just dont expect to intimidate your players with them|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|im not one of those brony dudes but i have seen a few episodes of my little pony with my daughter and zecora is a character design that stood out to me unlike the other ponies there wasnt a whole lot of zecora merchandise until just a few months ago this figure was supposed to be a  san diego comic con exclusive but was also sold by toys r us at around the same time when initially released zecora was pretty cheap now the msrp has doubled it seems that once they found out she was such a hot item they went the way of skylanders and increased the price knowing people would still pay for itzecora stands at about  inches tall from hoof to ear and her stylin mohawk adds another inch or two shes made of the same soft plastic as the other ponies in this scale and has a nicely rooted mohawk and tail they did a great job with the grey and white color of the hair and not a single hair is out of place her tail even has a braid around the top of it two pieces of different colored strings holding it in place making it look identical to how it does in the show her stripes and other designs are all here looking good as well the only thing they skimped out on is her upper left legs bracelets which are just painted on one side and not the otherlimited to just one point of articulation you can only move zecoras head around aside from being the only zecora in this scale the other selling point for this figure is the glow in the dark feature hold her up to a light for just a few seconds and then hit the lights to see her glow a nice bright green color her body glows a little brighter than her head does but it looks goodi suggest looking around for a god price on zecora this is a nice looking little figurefor the original price if you pay what sellers are currently asking for its not worth it unless you absolutely love zecora and need this figure wait|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|last year when i first saw the smaller stuffed regular show characters i wanted to get all of themexcept for rigby somehow his basic design didnt translate to plushform very well and he looked like the kind of person you see coming at you downtown lifting their shirt up partially scratching their face repeatedly and asking you for a few dollars these things were so unwanted at the toy store that the same ones are still there today not too long after those small ones came out bigger talking mordecai and rigbys were released youd think that this would be the chance to redeem poor plushrigby nope he looks just as bad here so much so that they use a prototype picture for the stock image on this page luckily the talking feature is cool and that saves it from  star in my bookas far as the quality goes rigby is wellmade and very soft they didnt overstuff him and the stitching is clean a lot of toy companies these days are taking beloved licenses and just pushing everything out without checking for quality just look at the hannabarbara toys that have come out over the last couple of years face problems aside there isnt anything bad to say about this guy another problem that sometimes plagues toys these days is that ones with talking features sometimes dont get the original voice actoractress to do the lines thats not the case here these are  rigby lines he says a handful of phrases with my favorite being the stop talking line just pull the string on his back and hell say a random phrasebut manthat facepictures dont do it justice seeing the toy right in front of you is a different experience every time i see these i cant believe that someone approved for it to be made if you think about getting this for one of your younger kids who love the character show it to them in a store to make sure they like it before ordering it as a surprise its almost as bad as the plush ren from ren  stimpy that mattel made back in the early s that has the worst face ive ever seen on a kids toycuddly a cool talking feature and good constructiona stopyouinyourtracks facial expression go with mordecai if you really want one of these hopefully a better version comes out at some point|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|right before our grandsons th birthday he turned into a major cars  fanatic and grandpa  i began a collection of the singles for him  a year and a half into amassing this large collection we were still three items shy of a total collection  one of those items was  from the deluxe singles line taco truck mater  in the movie theres a funny scene with mater finn mcmissile and holley shiftwell in which a computer uses a hologram to give mater various disguises one of which is a taco truck  wed gone ahead and purchased the disney store version  scale since the only mattel versions  scale we could find were loose andor outrageously expensive  with christmas around the corner we thought wed give it another try and saw him on amazon for a total price  shipping of   now that is a lot of money for a diecast car and mattels versions which are on a  scale feel more like a sturdy plastic than the actual metal feel of the disney store versions  however in midoctober when our search turned up only one other packaged version at  we decided to spend the money and complete his collectionthere are differences other than the obvious size difference between the mattel and disney store versions different facial expressions different shades of gray for the truck different lettering etc  but we see two neat things about mattels version the side lift gate actually opens and shuts unlike the disney store version and  in our opinion having purchased innumerable disney store items  the durable plastic feeling ones hold up much better to the rigors of play than the metal versions weve had to keep a supply of super glue on hand for the disney store models  taco truck mater is   long    wide and    tall  we know our grandsons going to be thrilled to get the last few pieces of his collection this christmas even if his grandparents werent too thrilled with the hefty price tag|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|we build a lot of legos  we just finished jabbas palace and we were very happy to see that there was a building set for star trek that was similar you figure a good deal on a lego set is  cents a piece so this one at  cents has a very similar price we were hoping a nonlego branded set would have a more reasonable price and figured the star trek licensing wouldnt add to the items cost like star wars does butapparently notwe loved star trek into darkness so it was really fun to get this set right after seeing the moviepros the star trek figures are great you get kirk spock mccoy and  starfleet dudes i like it that they have holes in the back of their legs so that you can attach them to the chairs on the bridge they all came in separate bags as with legos the hair tends to fall off the blue lights with different options if you press more than once for blinking etc on the deflector dish and nacelles is a nice plus and obviously adds to the price  needs  aaa batteries the dish top comes off and you have a cool bridge with seats for all the characters including a captains chair a screen with a display of space that goes up and down and some other small details that are cool the tops of the nacelles are hinged and you can see nice detail of the mechanics underneath the full color instruction book was good there are normal sideview details but they add a topdown view that is handy easy to grasp the model because the entire lower section is one piece that means its more friendly to my  year old than other similar block models that dont withstand any play at all  honestly none of the lego or kreo are really suited for play with younger children unless you either glue them or dont mind them falling apart i think this is really for display or if youre like me its something nice to play with on your desk at work just watch everyones eyes get big when you pull off the top of the disc and show them the bridge that said this did hold together better than other ships weve made recentlypotential cons the four pieces that together comprise the circle that attaches the disc to the body do not go on well or stay on well because the parts they connect to are not rigid enough  when bent or pressed even a little it comes apart however we used brushon super glue just on those  pieces and it worked like a charm assembly is a little more difficult than a comparable sized lego because they dont do bag  bag  etcyou open all the bags and combine them together so a bit more of a challenge finding the parts then again more challenging can be fun though most of the bricks are fine these didnt fit together with the six sigmamachined smoothness and steadiness that legos doi think its great to have a brickstyle buildable enterprise and were very happy with this|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the princess twilight sparkle toy is one that my daughter didnt have much interest in at all when i showed her pictures online a few days before twilight arrived in the mail i kept asking her if she thought it was a cool toy or if it was something she didnt care about of course not being much of a twilight sparkle fan she went with the latter but wouldnt you know it as soon as i took the giant pony out of the shipping box she changed her mindfor anyone who wanted bigger my little pony toys this is the one for you princess twilight sparkle is huge and chances are if your child is a fan of this particular pony theyre going to fall in love with this version of her the colors are bright and beautiful she comes with four different colored barrettes as well as a cool comb and of course theres the removable crown as with most mlp toys you can style her hair however you want unlike those other toys though princess ts sports a few more featuresaside from being huge i mean press twilghts cutie mark and shell talk and flap her wings or her horn will glow the wings can also flap when you roll her along the ground princes ts even has eyes that blink when she talks and sings making her come to life even moreoverall they did a pretty good job with the design of this toy its one thing to make a giant pony toy and another to really spruce it up with a couple of cool features there are a couple of issues though that keep her from being a  or even  star toy the main thing is the plastic used i know most kids who play with these toys are careful but theres always the chance that it might fall from a shelf or accidentally drop from ones hand the plastic doesnt feel that sturdy and i wouldnt be surprised if some of it chipped off in the event of an accident then theres the voice which doesnt sound at all like twilight sparkle that seems to be the big complaint with kids for this toy it even sounded off to me as soon as i heard it and ive only seen a handful of mlp episodes if it were just these two problems id gladly give the toy  out of  stars yet theres one glaring issue the price how in the world can this toy cost so much money i remember a buzz lightyear toy that came out about  years ago for the same price and it could move around dance and more compared to that twilight seems very limited in what she can do paying retail for this feels like youd be buying a big present yeah its big literally but not in value if your child loves it thats all that matters and thats awesome i just strongly recommend waiting for a price drop on this because for anything over  the original price it feels like a ripoff fortunately it was released recently and not in the winter time so theres a good chance shell reach a better price point by thenmy daughter really liked princess twilight sparkle for a week or so then moved right back to her other mlp toys and littlest pet shop like i said shes not a big fan of twilight sparkle rainbow dash derpy and chrysalis are her favorites so i understand little fans of the character though will probably adore this toy again shop around for a better price or just wait a while|ham
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|princess twilight sparkle is very large and a little heavy for my almost  year old so i would recommend that you go by their age recommendations her light purple body is made of hard plastic and three of her hooves have wheels peeking out on the bottom so that she can be rolled on the floor  when you roll her along her wings flap up and downher horn and wings light up different colors her eyelids blink and her head rotates a bit when you press the star button on her flank  she also says two lines and sings one little bit isnt it amazing now i have princess wingsisnt it ahmayyyyyziiiinnnngggg that my daughter likes to sing with herinterestingly my daughter doesnt press the button very often  she is more interested in brushing her hair with the comb and making pony tails with the four brightly colored barettes  my daughter will leave her in another room and ask my  year old son to get princess twilight for her and hell keep pressing the button all the way back to give it to hershe also comes with a tiara and a necklace  my daughter loves her and even takes her to bed  we wait until shes asleep then pull princess twilight sparkle off to the side since shes so big and hard|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|its become apparent that legos as a brand are on the rise  with the dizzying array of lego licensed video games and the upcoming movie legos are everywhere  but there are certain things legos wont do  they know their demographic and its suitably kidfriendly enter kreo a lego knockoff from hasbro thats determined to fill the gap for older gamers who want a little more bite zombie punintended in their toy blockstheres a few things this set includes that immediately indicate its divergence from your typical legos  for one the figures are a hybrid between minifigs and the larger figures  they have a one dot footprint like the minifigs but arms and legs like the larger figs  this allows them to wield weapons pistols and batons wear helmets and still take up very little space  this isnt quite as cool as it sounds as the figures have very little space to maneuver  lifting an arm can knock off a helmet or hair but lets face it anyone who wants this set wants it for the zombies and this set delivers three zombies plus a mystery zombie  its not really relevant who they are so much as they look like zombiesthe set up for this police station is formidable  there is an antizombie computer as well as a weapons rack and even a mixing station presumably to create the serum there are multiple levels of the station with three entry points that act as gates  two are to a zombie pen to keep the zombies in  the other is a large gate for vehicles in front of the stationspeaking of vehicles theres a police cruiser with the reverse jaws of life to capture zombies and plunge a syringe filled with the antidote  theres also a dual machinegun swivel mount and a large zombie detector on top of the stationthe centerpiece for all this blockbuilding is the sonic motion technology  the zombie detector the gun mount and three of what can only be described as surf boards all come with a protective cover that when removed reveals tiny rubber hairs  these rubber hairs act as cushions to make the various objects move when vibrated  and that vibrator is the bottom of the police stationit consists of an onoff button a mute button and two speed buttons  the speed adjusts the pitch of the noises the block makes as well as the vibration  the sounds consist of sirens zombies moaning and voice chatter on a walkie talkie  it all sounds bizarre when sped upin theory you place zombies or officers on the surfboards crank up the speed on the vibrating block and they sail around the terrain  this probably is more entertaining if its limited to zombies since its entirely random as to where they move but its also moot because it doesnt work  the blocks atypical of lego are not smooth  if you smoothed out the entire surface the surf boards might move  the zombie detector spins like mad and the gun mount doesnt do anything  but for the most part the illusion of movement is about as interesting as the effect you get from those old vibrating football games it becomes annoying after five minutesthis is a very detailed and interesting set but my six yearold was freaked out by the noises and needed plenty of help to put it together  probably more appropriate for tenyearolds and the tenyearold at heart|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|furreal toys always creeped me out i still remember seeing the duck a couple of years ago at the store and stopping dead in my tracks when i saw it come to life good lord i can remember it clearly even today the slow painful way it moved its head around looking you right in the eyes before a muffled electronic quack emitted out of its beak the line has stepped their game up though with this cuddles the monkey it doesnt make me feel much better than the duck did but cuddles at least has some better interactions than that thing ever did my daughter initially laughed at pictures of cuddles for the same reason i did she looks kinda freaky opening the box and taking her out without any batteries she still looks really weird however once shes activated and does things cuddles is a very cute toy thats sure to be a favorite for most kids who love stuffed animals or taking care of thingscuddles lives up to her name big time shes incredibly soft and cuddly despite having the mechanical parts inside she has multiple sensors that allow her to respond to your touch like patting her head so shell turn to you and give you a kiss pressing a finger or her included banana bottle on her tongue causes her to eat and make slurping sounds if you lift her left arm shell start to make cute sounds meaning shes ready to play the cutest feature is when you swing her upside down and cuddles starts to laugh and giggle squeeze her tummy theres a large button beneath the fur and shell laugh like shes being tickled and of course rocking her back and forth in your arms causes cuddles to go to sleep she can also go to sleep after a minute or so of inactivitycuddles requires  c batteries not included to work as usual with any toy thats going to be getting used regularly i recommend getting some rechargeable ones to save you money in the long run the power switch is located on cuddles caboose and turning her onoff and changing batteries will also probably wear out the tape on her diaper extra diapers are a must or you can just ditch it altogether or replace it with toddler underwear if you wantaside from eating batteries like theyre going out of style i cant think of anything bad to say about this toy except for maybe the price even then its a large toy that your child can play with and cuddle with at bedtime she could have had more features if they made it so her arms and legs would move on their own but at the same time that would make her less cuddlyif they make a duck in this size though im staying the heck away from it|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|i absolutely loved necas take on gollum so bilbo was a must buy hes in scale with gollum but that also means hes huge about a foot tall while hes not quite up to gollums levels of awesomeness i still love the final productfirst i think neca did a great job with detailing the clothes accessories and appendages especially the feet the paint job on the feet is incredibly realistic however the figure loses some points around the face area the face on the final product is a paler than whats shown in the prototype photos on amazons page id recommend searching for photos of the final product before buying him i think the face is fine but its a bit less lifelike than id hopedthe other big problem is with how bilbo grabs the sword the sword hand isnt flexible at all so you really have to force sting into it if youre not careful you might end up scratching the paint on the hand its a shame neca didnt find a better way to do this perhaps by giving us two sets of hands that could be replaced ive decided to just leave the sword in and never take it outoverall i definitely recommend getting this figure he looks great next to necas gollum which is a mustbuy|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|we were excited a couple of years ago when we saw a first in the takenplay line at walmart  some color change items  a couple of color change playsets thomas at the ironworks and this muddy adventure set that we picked up for  as well as a couple of themed  packs iron arrys oily mess and scruffs dirty mess  this set consists of a l h w brown plastic bridge that dips down in the middle which has yellow railing on its sides adding another  to the height appearing to be broken in the middle where the dip is  there are a couple of hinged grey pieces of track sprouting out from each end which can connect up to other playsets or additional track that can be folded up and tucked underneath the bridge for storage but theres no handle and no place to store the included thomas  when dry thomas has barely visible mud on his sides  your little one pours a little ice water into the dip and when thomas moves through it he gets splashed and the mud on his sides turns dark  not exactly elaborate but a fun little element that differentiates it from takenplays other basic setsgrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our oldert grandson the year it came out  when he was about    at the time it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  hes about to turn  this april and although his younger brother age  does a lot more playing with the collection now the older one still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation  unfortunately the line in general had gone downhill over the past couple of years so  was the last year of the collection  its a shame because wed intended on continuing it for our younger grandson but at least hell have the first few years of the collection to play with before fisherprice started cutting corners|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|my yrold daughter was extremely excited to see this toy come out of the box she loves mickey and minnie and was just so excited to play with the clubhouse the clubhouse in fact she did play with this toy for about a half an hour by herself after that she played with it along with her grandparents who had some trouble understanding how it workedassembly was fairly simple attach the slide put the microphone on the stand and attach the airplane to the big mickey head the directions were printed on the side of the box  a great idea for getting rid of paper directions but it took me a minute to find themit took me a minute to understand how the slide works the figures go inside the red hatch at the top and when you push down on the purple stand on the side of the mickey head the toodles hatch opens up for the character to come out and down the slideso  a cute toy overall but its not really a great toy and certainly not what ive come to expect from fischer pricehere are the issues weve encounteredthe plane a neat idea having a plane that you can put a character into that goes around the head the first problem was that my daughter didnt understand how to get a character into the plane their legs do bend and then you can sit them in the plane sort of they dont fit well in the seat because their hips are too wide mickey and minnie both as a result the characters fall out of the plane on the downswing around the head the other issue is that my kids were able to get the plane detached from the head this would not be great for a yrold who might want to stick the plane attachment in their mouththe slide characters do not actually slide down the slide after coming out of the hatch they fall out onto the stop of the slide where they stay until the kids push them down the slide the yrold wasnt too perturbed by this but i certainly wasthe hatch its not easy to get the characters into the top of the hatch because their arms stick out a little wide for that you can work them in but its not an easy fit the grandparents were not sure how to open the hatch  they figured it out eventually but then they didnt realize that it could be closed up againthe head grandparents complained that the toy tipped over easily the door opening on the side is cute and allows for lots of pretend play with characters showing up to the clubhouse for a visit there is a handle on the top of the head which is nice for the person that cleans up the toys namely mom but its not like the toy is selfcontained it comes with a teetertotter seesaw and a table and chairs for the characters to sit in but its not like you can store them inside the head and take them around without them falling outthe majority of the problems with the toy can be traced back to the characters theyre too big and too heavy we plan on using other characters from other toys when we play with this toy the kids are not too upset by the problems we encountered they just play like they always do even so i dont know how much replay this toy is going to get once the novelty factor wears off|ham

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|for my sixteenth birthday my parents threw me a birthday party at the laundry mat that my mom operated it was a family run business from my mons side that extended several generations back from the time they came to america from asia we used the laundry mat to host many events due to the spacious area and ample tables provided to seperate and fold their clothes onknowing that i was a fan of the batman cartoons movies and comic books it seemed an obvious theme for a birthday party val kilmer being my favorite batman ever curse you baleas the story goes my dad being a fit  japanese man raised in hawaii wanted to rent a val kilmer costume from the movie batman forever at the party store but they did not have one in his size even if he did not wear the boots and some black sandals the suit was just too big most likely it was intended for one of those disgustingly overweight comic con attendees trying to be coolwhat did end up becoming available that fit my father was the adam west batman costume in light of being nostalgic that seems to be the one batman that makes everyone smile my father knew that would definitely be one of the highlights of the birthday partythrough the course of events as birthday parties go while my mother was bringing out the candlelit soy birthday cake the intent was that my father dressed as batman would jump out of a stand up coinoperated dryer and suprise me and everyone elsesadly as simple as it was to be it did not play out that waythe dryer that he and my mom planned sneaking into before the cake was brought out was in use and so he had to use another one mother stepped away to check on the cake in the microwave and missed the dryer he had climber into when the birthday song began mother slowly brought out the cake and i was anticipating my suprise at any momentthat moment never happened so we sang the second verse to the birthday songstill nothing happenedwhat did happen was while the singing was going on there was a heavyset hispanic woman wearing a headphone radio set  to tune out what might of been her four screaming kids and two barking dogs running about as she put the coins in the wrong loaded dryer and started it up she was completely oblivious to the dire situation about to unfold the  doors automatically locked and remain so until the dryer has completed its entire cycle it was a government regulated safety featureno one heard my father screaming it was too late by the time we found him and waited for the dryer to stopwe had a service at the same laundry mat and burried him in the dryer at a nearby cemetaryto this day i still believe that the rubberized to appear armored costume that the wise val kilmer wore would of protected him if anything the heat from the dryer would of impervious due to its fire resistant materialsthis is a greatlooking figure from the pictures that i have seen but it also brings back memories of my father that brings me a sense of solemn reverencehence the onestar ratingrespect|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|this slate loading station playset is basically just a colorchanged differentlabeled version of takenplays load  go which featured sodor shipping co playset it appears fisherprice promised an exclusive to toysrus but didnt want to spend any more money in development of something completely new  however load  go was one of our grandsons absolute favorite playsets and since this new set is a blue mountain mystery destination we did add it to his collection  if your little one loves thomas especially if you missed out on load  go we definitely recommend this  its one of the most elaborate playsets and has many neat features and great detailing  the outside of this colorful playset is the front of an orangeyellow building with slate loading station along with the bmq logo standing for blue mountain quarry in big white letters at the  top which also has a couple of yellow doors and a few windows where the offices must be  theres a yellow pivoting loader that the included thomas and his bright red rail car  loaded with removable blue quarry rock or a couple of gold barrels  can pull up to on the semicircular track in the front of the building to unload and then chug on inside to the quarry site  theres a grey  blue gantry crane that slides back and forth across the loading site with a knob at the top that can be twisted to raise and lower the crane hook  the grey track itself is very neat  starting on a nd tier behind the front top of the building you can raise the yellow gate arm to let thomas slide down a ramp and around a bend where he can head either to the loading area to the left or the blue quarry area to the right  a couple of yellow signs a railroad crossing  a double arrow that you can plug into various places in the set are also included and there are  places where you can connect it up to other sets or track we paid  for this at toysrus actually a few bucks less than we paid for load  go  if you can find it for around that price we think its a good bet youll find it was money well spentthe only thing id caution is that if you want a set your youngster can easily and quickly take on the road with you you might want to consider one of the   under msrp playsets instead  update  there are  tnp sets as of summer  that are what ive come to categorize as elaborate with msrps of   up and they are in order of introduction  rescue from misty island rock quarry run load  go rumbling gold mine run thomas at pirates cove the dieselworks the great quarry climb thomas at the ironworks thomas adventure castle slate loading station and lion canyon i wouldnt recommend them for easy transport  those are the only ones that grandma says have to stay put in the basement  theyre great if you plan to keep them set up at homegrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  although recently weve seen a few signs that fp may be cheapening the line using more plastic instead of metal eliminating the chugging sounds of the talking engines as they move along the track etc well keep collecting them as long as he still shows an interest  hell be  at the end of this month and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement with his little brother just turning  last month it wont be long before hes playing with them too so were likely to be collecting for several years to come  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|grandma  grandpa made an early christmas purchase the second we saw this  playset introduced in conjunction with s blue mountain mystery movie and making its first appearance on the  collector checklist on amazon at a penny below fisherprices january   msrp with free shipping  update  fisherprices summer  msrp was still   the good thing about being grandparents was we didnt have to wait until christmas to check it out wow  its so neat that it had us counting the days til christmas  another colorful addition to the takenplay line the track itself  and theres a lot of it  is a combination of an attractive shade of blue along with the typical greyishsilver features  inclines with a blue pivot wall at the bottom of the steepest incline and a blue rock support underneath the other curves and four points where it can be connected up to additional track or playsets  new character owen an enthusiastic traction engine and the rd nontrain character to be featured in a playset with cranky at the docks and colin at the wharf being the others is a light brown and is perched atop a grey and blue tower  the bright red drop saw tower has a bluewhite bmq blue mountain quarry sign at the top while the drop is a goldishorange with a silver saw  the tower base also includes a spinning goldishorange turntable and a grey loading zone and now for the action  when you give thomas included a nudge down the incline of blue track he passes over a lever that activates the spinning dropsaw  it drops down and cuts a slab of plastic bluestone which plops right into the cargo car brown plastic with  black wheels  both the rail car  cargo are also included  you bring thomas around the bend passing underneath the steep grey track incline and onto the turntable which is positioned underneath the blue track incline spinning it to allow thomas to back into the loading zone to connect up to his cargo car  thomas heads back onto the track via the turntable passes back underneath the steep incline around the bend and moving the pivot wall brings thomas to the base of the incline  you pull a cord located underneath the bay area connected to owen down fitting the metal cover at the end of the cord over thomass connecting magnet  you then hold down a lever located on owens back which allows owen to pull thomas and his cargo up the incline and into the bay  the detailing on these sets has always been great and this ones no exceptionoh my goodness our grandson was so thrilled with this set at christmas  as soon as we set it up he immediately brought winston sir topham hatts track inspection vehicle mr percival head of the narrow gauge railway in his little red car and all of his narrow gauge engines to live there  he likes to have homes for all of his engines so now  of his  narrow gauge engines are in their new digs skarloey  rheneas  sir handel  peter sam  rusty  fearless freddie  duke aka granpuff mighty mac  characters  mighty and mac  in one train and of course the newest member little luke   victor the only narrow gauge engine on sir topham hatts railway is the only exception  our grandson keeps him at the sodor steamworks repair shed with his sidekick kevin since thats where they workthe only thing id caution is that if you want a set your youngster can easily and quickly take on the road with you you might want to consider one of the   under msrp playsets instead  update  there are  tnp sets as of summer  that are what ive come to categorize as elaborate with msrps of   up and they are in order of introduction  rescue from misty island rock quarry run load  go rumbling gold mine run thomas at pirates cove the dieselworks the great quarry climb thomas at the ironworks thomas adventure castle slate loading station and lion canyon i wouldnt recommend them for easy transport  those are the only ones that grandma says have to stay put in the basement  theyre great if you plan to keep them set up at homegrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  unfortunately weve seen too many signs over the past year that fp is cheapening this line using more plastic instead of metal eliminating the chugging sounds of the talking engines as they move along the track etc so this will be the last year of our collection  our grandson turned  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement with his little brother now  months old it wont be long before hes playing with them too so were glad we made the investment while it was still a high quality line  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|unfortunately this will be our last year collecting takenplay for our older grandson so we were so pleased to see duck finally arrive in time to include him  hes been around forever in the railway series books even though he hadnt appeared in the tv series for about  years until he returned this year  hes the cheerful but nononsense engine with gwr standing for great western railway on his sides takenplays version also has a  and he doesnt take any lip from anybody  his real name is actually montague but is called duck because he has a waddling gait  interestingly when reverend w awdry who authored the railway series of books that inspired the tv series received his model of montague for his railway the wheels were uneven which caused him to appear to waddle  his children nicknamed him duck and thats what hes been called ever sincewe spent a bit more  on amazon than fisherprices  msrp for duck but since the shipping was free and we saved ourselves a trip to the store we went ahead and added him to our cart  we wouldve enjoyed continuing the collection for our younger grandson but weve seen too many reductions in the general quality of the line over the past year which is a shame  it was a good ride while it lasted|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|my kids are huge pokemon fanatics and begged me to buy some of the pokemon figures and the pokemon battle arena my eldest is  years old and he ripped it out of the box and claimed the pokemon he wanted while his sister screamed then i got it set up and turned it to  player quick mode so they could practice nice having the batteries in and ready  i had already watched the tomy pokemon battle arena videos on youtube so that i could explain everything to themto start they didnt understand how to select their pokemons type example fire water grass i showed them the attack tags for their selected pokemon and named some pokemon they knew well pikachu axew leavani to help them understand the different types i reminded them of some interesting battles they had seen like the episode where pikachu uses thundershock but it doesnt have any effect so i helped them select their types and we got started in quick mode which helps you practice for the real battlepound pound pound pound the kids hit their red buttons and pounded them as fast as they could you could see the led battle display showing the wave of attack  we then tried battle mode  fireworks  the kids were so excitedi gave them time to just pound it out then i tried to teach them to do the forwardattack backwarddefend movements they just werent very good at it  however i think an  year old would probably do fantastic with the real gameplay that the arena allowspros led display is colorful and draws in the kids attention can be either one player or two player has a practice mode and a battle modecons pokemon figures dont always stay in the attack base holder well younger kids struggle with real gameplay the videosads all talk about how knowledge of the pokemon types is important like the timing of the attacks and defenses but after all this time i just dont think that is really present in the current gameplay doesnt come with well known pokemon so if your kids are like mine youre going to be buying more  in fact full battle mode means  pokemon eachin summary my feeling is that the battle arena could have been just a little more straightforward but i think kids a little older than mine would have fun with it|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|we didnt think fisherprice could get any more bare bones with takenplay playsets than tidmouth tunnel or sodor lumber company with  msrps but they surely did with  new sets this one actually called percy portable set as well as a thomas portable set and a diesel portable set  unlike percys mail delivery with an msrp of  with its little enclosed maithwaite mail building for percy to be enclosed in for storage and with nice designing on the inside of the track this one has a seethough tunnel that flips and snaps over percy for storage  though this does connect up to other playsets or additional track it is definitely basic no extra designing whatsoever  we realize it sounds a bit cynical but we think these new sets are a way to snag those with budgets of under  to dip their toe in the water as far as the world of takenplay thomas  friends the recipients will soon discover how quickly it adds up when they want to expand  we waited until amazon lowered the thomas set to  and the diesel set to  before adding them to our grandsons collection and well wait until the percy set is under  as well  since the trains themselves each have an msrp of  by themselves we were okay with thatgrandpa and i started collecting takenplay for our first grandson the year it came out  when he was about    at the time it was a high quality line of trains vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us  we love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures  he turned  in april and still looks forward to visiting his sodor land of make believe in our basement his little brother is  months old and it wont be long before hes playing with them too  hopefully when grandpa and i are no longer around one day their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are and theyll be able to share more special memories with the next generation  unfortunately the line in general has gone downhill over the past year so this will be the last year of the collection  at least our younger grandchild will have the first few years of the collection to play with before fisherprice started cutting corners|ham
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters slowly building an army of ponies and sunset shimmer is one that she wanted as soon as she saw the character on the show for a while it seemed like this was going to be one of those figures that diehard fans hunt down as soon as they arrive in stores but shes becoming much easier to find nowsunset shimmer fits in with the other ponies of this scale perfectly and has a nice color scheme to boot she looks how youd expect a toy of her to look and the cutie mark looks pretty cool too theres really not much you can say about one of these toys since they all follow the same model save for wings or a horn sunset comes with a pink brush and a masquerade mask the mask looks great though theres a problem with it its made out of paper chances are that most kids playing with these toys will be pretty careful with them but a paper accessory is always trouble to keep in good condition one wrong tug on the elastic band attached to it and there it goes thats really the only thing to look out for with this toy the mask does look awesome when sunset shimmer is wearing it though she almost looks like a luchador when viewed from the front and thats always gonna get bonus points in my booknow that shes easier to find sunset shimmer shouldnt be going for insane prices on here you can find her in most store that carry mlp toys for a little less too|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters favorite pony is rainbow dash sure she likes a couple of the others too but rainbow dash beats them all since my little pony friendship is magic came out there have been a lot of rainbow dash dolls and figures released in a short period of time and yet only a few of them look like rd as she appears in the show funko recently stepped up and started making larger vinyl figures of the ponies first with derpy and now with rainbow dash derpy has already sold out twice and rd here will likely follow in her hoofsteps the figure was just released a few weeks ago so finding one at the moment shouldnt be too hard i strongly recommend buying one now though as this is the kind of thing thats going to shoot up in price quickly vinyl figures are extremely collectible and with mlps rabid fan base scoring one of these in even a month from now will probably be a challengerainbow dash comes in a cool black box just like derpy but with her image on the side the great thing about the box is that it has a large window so you can see how the figure looks before buying if youre getting this at that warm subject store this is a big deal and ill tell you why in a minute rd stands at almost  inches tall and has a good amount of weight to her this isnt a hollow figure no shes solid vinyl her cutie mark looks as it should and her eye coloring seems to be right the wings look great too im glad that funko made these figures look like how the characters appear in the show from the shape of the hair to the faces the only real point of articulation is the head which you cant really move around because of her hair its not a big deal though since most vinyl figures dont have much articulation and are usually made to stay in one pose its a collectible not an action figurenow for the big problem quality control when we went to get this figure there were about  of them on the shelf every single one of them except for one had a defect of some kind paint chipping one color on the tail going into another portion weird marks on rainbow dashs face glue on the wing seeping out of the slot some people have even gotten figures with half of the cutie mark missing im guessing they rushed the production of these figures big time my other issue is that the wings do seem like they could come off easily like if the figure tipped over on its side as long as youre careful with it everything should be ok finally are the errors with the figure rainbow dashs cutie mark is supposed to be on her left sidenot the right i didnt even know this until a fan pointed it out and you know what that is the kind of thing they should have paid better attention to when making these the other nitpick is i guess rd doesnt have blue on the top of her hair i just did a quick image search to check on this and sure enough ms dash doesnt have blue there is it a big deal not really but something im sure hardcore fans will ruffle their feathers overthese vinyl figures are a good deal as long as you pay the original msrp theyre big colorful and definitely stand out from all the other mlp toys out so far i suggest trying to find one in the store though if you care about getting one without any paint problems and like i said get one now while you still can derpys already gone|spam

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|having two heavyset native american parents i have always struggled with my weight by the time i reached sixteen in sixth  grade i was five foot eleven and weighed in at twoeighty five most of the kids in my class hadnt even begun to shave yet let alone be able to legally drive living on a reservation most kids drive as soon as their feet reach the peddals while seeing over the steering wheelwith halloween coming up i wanted to impress my three kids all boys  by dressing up as batman  unfortunately the drug store we usually buy our halloween costumes at was all sold out of batman costumes the closest thing they had batmanrelated that actually fit me was the dick york robin costume from the s batman tv show my boys wanted to dress up as power puff girls because they love the show being on a fixed income i only had enough money for the unelected presidential elect john mccain costumes that were on sale no one really likes him here in arizonathat night my boys and i went trick or treating in the trailer park next to our duplex behind the jiffy lube my dad works at sometimeswhen we got to one of the trailers we could see a bowl of brachs neaopolitan coconut sundaes through the partially open window next to the fish tank however no one answered the door with the tv on we figured they could not hear us being robin that night i decided i would grab the nearby waterhose throw one end of it over the trailer while my three boys held onto that end and i could scale the wall the retrieve our candygood plan in theory onlyi ended up spliting my tight green shorts having a hairline fracture on my coccyx and spent the night in the er that in itself would of been enough but child services and the cops where there as well asking me all sorts of questionsas a memento of that less than funfilled night with my boys i got this action figure setmy only gripe about it is that it looks like they are scaling a wall horizontally instead of vertically that seems kind of lazy to me|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|a few months ago i got the deluxe chunli hello kitty plush and i absolutely adore her i gave her  stars only because the materials used for her outfit werent that durable well everything i said about the big sister applies here this is the exact same plush only smaller fans of street fighter and hello kitty need look no further for a cool collectible from both series and now that the bigger version seems to be sold out you should hurry up and get one of these mini ones before shes gone for good toomini chunli stands at about  inches tall and is much cuter inperson than she appears in stock pictures when i first saw images of her i thought something looked off like the head was too far down on the body thats not the case with the real plush fortunately this little hello kitty is adorable and looks great when paired with the bigger version her outfit is pure chunli all the way no ones going to mistake her for a different sf character the boots bracelets hair bun thingies nylons everythings here sure theres a few missing details on the dress but this is a different take and style on the character so of course its not going to be the exact same as the real one the big blue bow is a nice touch and personally i think she looks better with itthis plush only has two things that might be a hazard for very young kids plastic eyes and a plastic nose theyre put in pretty well though and it shouldnt be something to worry about if youre giving this to a very young child as i mentioned above the only thing keeping her from being a  star product is that the materials for her outfit arent as good as they could be the ribbons on the hair bun thingies came frayed and some stuffing fibers were sticking out of her dress in a few spots dont get me wrong she doesnt feel cheap at all its just that they tried to give her dress that satin look and accomplished it but at the cost of durability i guess this still shouldnt keep you from buying hermost of the sanrio street fighter characters havent appealed to me im still waiting on the soweirdtheyrecute zangief and e honda plush characters and ill eventually get an akuma aside from them im not a big fan of the other designs chunli hello kitty a must plain and simple even if you already have the bigger version this little one is too cute to pass up im very happy i got her in my stocking this year|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughters on a big ninja turtles kick right now she picked out a tmnt backpack for first grade this year as well as a tmnt lunchbox that she loves when i saw this flying attack game it looked like fun we dont play that many board games the main ones being nightmare before christmas operation and candyland but i knew shed be up for playing anything with the turtles maybe it was the universe telling me that playing the game wasnt going to be a good experience because for some reason i held off until yesterday to finally open up the box and play the gamewe played for about  minuteshands down tmnt flying attack is the worst board game experience ive ever had its worse than playing perfection when i was  years old terrified of the timer counting down as i frantically tried my best to get all the pieces in before the game erupted its worse than when id play battleship with my neighbor when i was  and theyd only use one boat on the map instead of all of them heck that sounds like a lot of fun now compared to ever playing this game again dont take my statement above wrong when i say that we played for about  minutes it was just that we spent even more time trying to play this game this whole board game is just a mess that i dont have anything positive to say about it at allso you build the tower eventually and you can play one of two ways the first and probably the only one youre going to try is launching the turtles at members of the foot clan as theyre hanging from the tower with their grappling hooks the other method involves one person being shredder and the other playing as the turtles shredders trying to get a couple of key objects to start doing some evil business and its up to the turtles to knock  foot clan ninjas off the tower before he can do it luckily for them shredder wont win as another reviewer pointed out its pretty much impossible for shredder to even come close to winningthe key problem with the game is how poorly balanced the tower is when assembled youre supposed to put a lot of the pieces wherever you want yet when i tried to distribute them evenly the tower would still lean the green plastic rods that hold the tower up arent that strong either and there were a couple of times when theyd come apart just when id move the thin cardboard pieces onto them its hard enough getting the foot clan to stay hanging from the tower as it is and constant wobbling ensures they wont be there for long the foot clan pieces are one piece of cardboard including the grappling hooks theyre holding and it curves to allow them to hang unfortunately theres no slot to put the grappling hook side in so the cardboard pieces are just hanging there with nothing to keep them in place you can launch one turtle piece at the tower and theres a good chance itll have enough force to knock all of the foot clan downthats where another problem lies though only two of the turtle pieces we have were able to fit into the catapult properly donatello and leonardo had no problems but raphael and michelangelo wouldnt go into the slot for anything why is the majority of this game made of cardboard why not just make small plastic turtle game pieces like say the candyland gingerbread men is that too much to ask they wouldnt even have to be that detailed or anything  times out of  id miss the tower because its hard to tell how far you should be from it even with the measuring piece they included with the gamewhen we finished a game my daughter went right back to playing with her monster high dolls and i just left the game tower where it was if she asks to play it again of course we will but i dont see that happening i will give the game  stars in the educational value category because this would make for an excellent example of what a board game shouldnt be only buy this game if your kid is a huge huge fan of the turtles and if its  the price its currently at right now|ham

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|bought this penguin figure for my son who loves to the game batmanarkham citywhen his mom has to work her night job as a waitressdancer at some exclusive gentlemens club called bowmans involving scantlyclad women and farm animals on stage that i am not to go into thanks to a restraining order she leaves him with me he likes to stay up all night playing video games so i thought he might like an action figure from one of the games he enjoysbesides it keeps him occupied when i am not home on the nights it conflicts with the poker games with my buddies he is almost six years old and handles himself pretty wellthis looks like a good figure but i never really took the time to look at it up close since i just left it with him while he was playing grand theft auto as i was walking out the door the other nightwhen i came home the next day my son had left for the day but the figure and faint smell of smoke remainedmy only real gripe with the figure as for the low rating is the one cigarette the figure comes with it was clear that the play time value was significantly reduced with the lack of meaningful accessories|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|for the most part the takenplay playsets have been terrific and we did an amazon price check one more time  as of  before heading to kmart to get one for our grandson at   under fisherprices  msrp  good deal we thought it looked pretty neat with  spiral tracks sprouting out from the left and the right of the top of the bright orange castle and has lots of neat features like a trip switch as thomas included descends that causes flags to unfurl and drops a treasure down  there are also knights that appear a drawbridge that lowers as well as a plastic troublesome truck with plastic removable gold treasure and eight places  in front  in back  on one of the sides to connect it up to other takenplay sets or additional track  you start by lifting the handle to set the engine gates set the two flags by flipping them up and latching them to the ramp set the cargo drop feature and place the treasure into position set the drawbridge by flipping it into the upright position and place thomas with his troublesome truck at opposite points at the tops of the two ramps behind the release gates  when you lower the handle its supposed to release thomas and the troublesome truck down the ramps as they roll down the track the treasure drops the flags flip down and they come together to knock down the drawbridge as the knights pop up  pretty clever  the treasure can be displayed on a platform which is supposed to lift up as the thomastroublesome truck pass  this is for age  but adult assembly is definitely requiredwell because troublesome truck is made of plastic instead of the diecast metal thomas is made of one of the big reasons this is the last year of the takenplay collection we started for our grandson in  heavy use of plastic now he is so light that when you lift the handle to release them only thomas descends most of the time  on the instances where troublesome truck does happen to descend and meets up with thomas sometimes they hook up sometimes they crash into each other but either way thomas ends up flipped over once he gets through the drawbridge  and the platform does not easily lift up as they pass you have to push thomas with a definite level of pressure before it will lift up  we werent sure whether to deduct one star or two because of this it does include a specially designed thomas with a castle crest and hes festooned with ribbons so we settled on a  star  the set is okay  our grandson plays with it and doesnt get as annoyed as we do that it doesnt work as described but when we compare this set to the elaborate sets of the past it just doesnt match up  we see amazon lowered it to  as of  maybe we wouldnt be as irritated as we are right now if wed paid that price definitely not worth its  msrpif you want a set your youngster can easily and quickly take on the road with you you might want to consider one of the   under msrp playsets instead  there were  tnp sets as of summer  that are what ive come to categorize as elaborate with msrps of   up and they are in order of introduction  rescue from misty island rock quarry run load  go rumbling gold mine run thomas at pirates cove the dieselworks the great quarry climb thomas at the ironworks thomas adventure castle slate loading station and lion canyon i wouldnt recommend them for easy transport  those are the only ones that grandma says have to stay put in the basement  most of them are great if you plan to keep them set up at home|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|im not quite sure whom this doll is for i bought it for my niece who loves arial both are redheads as other reviewers have noted the design of the doll is beautiful arial has a very pretty face and a charming aesthetic the dress is very detailed with some embroidery on the front and sparkles throughout i also noticed the neck arm and wrist joints are well hiddenbut there are some parts of the doll that make me think this is for collectors and some that make me think shes for kids the price is actually not all that high for a barbielike doll however as others have noted the legs are stiff and made of cheap plastic this means ariel cant really sit or drive a car not sure why youd want her to but some kids might try the dress isnt stiff but one also has to wonder how durable it isat the end of the day the little charm bracelet makes it clear the primary market is for kids however id recommend treating this doll better than most keep her in the box when the kids arent playing with her id say the ideal market for this doll is a combination of a little girl who wants to play with ariel and an adult who appreciates disney princesses|spam
A2WW57XX2UVLM6|overall reviewthe newest dream townhouse improves on the previous  story dreamhouse in quite a few smart ways  moving the elevator to the center gives a nice focal point and makes all the rooms a bit more accessible  gone is the deckhottub and in its place is a great walk in closet for keeping barbies fashions and accessories the layout is better as well  less unused floor space and situating the furniture against the back wall instead of all over  it makes it easier to use the rooms furniture  i especially liked the pegs on the countertop that allow all the little accessories to click in and not fall over or get lost  thats a vast improvement over the previous deramhouseas with all dreamhouses the following issues still apply  you will get assembly instructions with pictures that make it hard to figure out what to do electronics doorbells flushing toilet etc will all need to be tested before assembly to make sure the house is fully working mattel barbie toys have a poor track record for working accessories sadly the elvators never work smoothly  i had high hopes for this one but sadly the same problem persists youd think itd be solved in  years and the elevator catches on floors and gets stuck  in fact we gave up on the elevator all together in last years dreamhouse modeldeciding on a new home for barbiethe townhouse malibu dreamhouse beach house glam vacation house pink world house fashion fairytale palace lightup castle etc all offer something different for barbie in particular the townhouse is a much better deal when compared to the malibu dreamhouse  for about  more barbie gets an elevator a lot more furniture and a house that takes up more wall space than floor space as well the townhouse suits barbie scale much better than the malibu dreamhouse which can feel a bit crowded the glam vacation house and pink world house dont have much in the way of ceilings or floors mostly just walls so girls dont really feel like they have a house my  year old never really liked the pink house  it took up too much room in her floor and since it didnt have much of a floor furniture fell over constantly on carpet as for the fairytale dvd movie houses they are built specifically for a character and regular barbies may seemfeel very out of place the dream townhouse gives plenty of roominess for a variety of the more inexpensive barbies such as the fashionistas whose articulated arms and legs go well with the townhouseif you are deciding on whether to get the old or the new dreamhouse the old dreamhouse is heavily discounted id suggest spending the extra money for the new version  the improvements really make this far more usable and a better experienceassembling the dream townhouseas noted above install batteries and check all electronics before assembling mattel does have an assembly video that you can access as well   version dream townhouse to get an idea of how to put it together but honestly it wasnt that hard mattel has been smart and designed it such that you match up shapes to pieces and pieces all come in different widths so they wont snap into the wrong place this was the same case with the monster high school playset and made sure that you assembled once and were done ikea has also gone this route thankfully assembly ideally takes  minutes at most including taking out of the package the graphics are setalready there thankfully so no annoying stickers to put togetherdurabilitythe houses of the past tended to be put together in roomsized pieces and so broke down fairly easily due to lack of a solid base the newer dreamhouses comes with one solid wall piece with folding permanently attached floors this gives some durability to the house once the floors are dropped it is held together by the thick columns on each level the top level then fits onto the second floor top the elevator has a track and fortunately the new design means that sagging parts dont cause it to fall out as easily  though the rickety plastics used inevitably mean the elevator sticks the newer plastics also seem to contribute to the variations in track sizes for the elevators  often requiring a bit of modification if your elevator doesnt work well or as designed but that said this is much better quality than the previous dream townhouseaestheticsits great to see barbie adding in more colors than pink or white though there was an odd yellow fold out house in the s this townhouse has blue flooring in the middle and there are some purples thrown in for variety plus many shades of pinks  dark to light  add interest note that the color isnt as saturated as in the images on amazon so it isnt as eye wincingly bright the house is a good scale for barbie and the dolls dont feel crowded though ken might be a bit tall for the middle level as well it makes a beautiful display for barbies when not in playalternativesthe barbie dream house is the top of the line barbie house and is priced accordingly keep in mind that there are other alternatives if you dont wantneed the barbie branding or would like a house not made of plastic kidcraft has an excellent line of full wood with full color graphics doll houses that are priced comparably to this house those doll houses are also barbiescale and ideal for a larger doll collection that may include moxie bratz etcsummaryin all this is an improvement and provides more value for money than the other barbie houses quality variation issues keep this from being a  star product as well as the hefty price  the elevator doesnt always work well and the electronics especially may not all work|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W| but you should probably check it out before ordering since the model  for the original was cbm and for the fire  rescue version is cbn  this listing says the model  is x which is neither of them  but since it looks like the fire  rescue version thats what ill reviewwe figured chug would have to return in the planes sequel  hes a fuel truck who is dustys good friend and biggest supporter similar to lightning mcqueen and mater in the cars town of radiator springs  his mentor skipper and boss leadbottom also return so i was trying to determine if there were enough differences in the diecasts from the separate movies to warrant a purchase of a second version of each  as far as chug goes the differences i see are he has silver bumpers with rust versus the brown bumpers of the first version the far right  left lights on his cab roof protrude upward versus not protruding on the first version looks like a lot more rust or dirt perhaps on his doors and fenders and it appears his hubcaps are silver versus brown on the first version  hmm decisions decisions  ill figure that out while im waiting for the price to come down toys r us is selling a bunch of these mattel  scale fire  rescue figures for  as of  which is right at the  msrp  amazons free shipping price is much higher as of the same date but well be holding onto them as christmas gifts so ive got plenty of time  in the meantime our  year old grandson is beside himself with excitement about going to see the sequel with us on april th and meeting all of the new characters who work together putting out wildfires at piston peakthe mattel diecast collections cars  and the original planes have just been such a great investment for us with two grandsons already and another due to arrive in september  the feel is more of an extremely sturdy plastic rather than metal but weve found thats exactly what makes them stand up to rougher play than the disney stores larger  scale models  their handsome display cases is probably where they ought to stay the much heavier metal concentration means the small pieces are more brittle and break off so easily  weve really been pleased with the level of durability and the planes models have lived in our home for  months with all propellers and wheels still intact despite more nosedives than we can begin to count  would love to see them end up in the hands of our great grandkids someday|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|weve derived so much pleasure in watching our grandsons enjoyment of his cars collection so as soon as he got wind of the planes spinoff we made up our minds immediately what collection wed begin next  excited isnt a good enough word to describe the way his eyes lit up when he opened his christmas gifts of the planes dvd accompanied by as many of the characters as we were able to find  hes been having the time of his life  ishani is racer  the exotic panasian champion from india is main character dusty crophoppers love interest in the movie and she is dropdead gorgeous  we hear shes modeled after an aerocad aerocanard and her redyellow paint is striking  although you cant mistake ishani we like it that her name is delicately painted right next to her   her characters voice is done by priyanka chopra s miss world no less  we happened across ishani as part of a nice target  pack called wings around the globe containing some of dustys primary competitors it also included ripslinger el chupacabra and bulldog  what a relief not to have to look all over the place for each one individually and the price was right  so it was right at mattels  msrp for eachwe knew from experience with mattels versions of the cars compared to disney stores versions that mattels  planes models were the right ones for us  though disney stores cars and planes are very neat looking larger  scale and made with a heavier diecast metal compared to the feel of a very sturdy plastic that we think the mattel models have we always had trouble with pieces breaking off which was very frustrating  durability is the name of the game for us since were hoping well be able to box up his collections and save them for sometime in the future when he can reintroduce them to his own kids|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|while not quite the bear trap layin southern hunter from the first iteration of the tmnt cartoons this leatherhead is a more deadly looking take on the classic characterbecause now hes a good guy the sculpt is great with tons of scales covering his body and three rows of spikes from head to tail as well as two rows that just go down his shoulders theres even a little bit of damage to his chest which is always a neat extra detail to throw in the face has a nice neutral look to it with many teeth shown and his eyes dont have pupils showing that he might be having a nightmare again his feet and wrists are taped up and that about does it for sculpting details as hes pretty much just a big alligator like i said everything looks good and i like how theyre doing this whole hollowed out thing with the bigger characters leatherheads feet and  of his tail are hollow making it easier to stand him up without there being too much weight holding him back his tail has to be attached out of the box but its simple and theres very little chance of it breaking the only points of articulation are on the head shoulders upper legs and tailsadly there are three things keeping this from being a  star figure when it has a  star sculpt first up is the obvious one the size leatherhead isnt anywhere near as menacing as he is in the show in this smaller form being dwarfed by a couple of other figures in the line i have to agree with another reviewer who said itd be fun to include a piece of him with several others from this series and have him be the build a figure that a lot of other toy lines do maybe have the limbs and tail included with the turtles and splinter and the body and head included with two of the bad guys and youd have the essential characters and a big cool leatherhead i also didnt care for the lack of any accessories his tail only takes up so much room in the boxthey should have included something else i also didnt like that his arms only had articulation at the shoulders no elbow or wrist articulation lamethis is one of those figures that despite how cool he looks its just disappointing that they didnt do something more no extra head with an open mouth for when hes enraged no weapons of any kind nothing heck they could have made him bigger and charged twice as much as the standard tmnt figure and id be ok with it still leatherhead is one of the more popular characters and if your child needs another good guy to help fight shredder leatherhead is a great ally for the turtles|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|the original line of tmnt figures  years ago was full of crazy and cool villains slash napoleon bonafrog leatherheadthere were tons to go up against the turtles one of the newest villains from the new animated series is snakeweed and the first bad guy my daughter got recently there are a lot of great ones out already for the new series and snakeweed is definitely a standout imagine if bushroot from darkwing duck just had enough one day and finally snappedand ditched the purple hairsnakeweed stands at about  inches tall when assembled thats right you get to build this guy his antennae handvines and feet are detached in the package but assembly is easy and its going to be hard to break anything when inserting the pieces when hes ready to go snakeweed looks sinister and imposing hes quite a bit taller than any of the turtles the guy stands easily without falling over thanks to his huge feet theyre wide and hollow making for a lightweight figure thats still sturdy he has pretty good articulation too for an oddshaped figure you can move his head upper body arms wrists upper legs and slightly move his knees snakeweed is always going to be with his feet sticking out a bit from his body making him look a little weird from the side hes still very capable of some cool poses with all those vinesthe sculpt and paint are great and true to the animated model on the show i have no complaints in these categories snakeweed doesnt come with any accessories but since hes so big its not a big problem overall this is a cool figure and a great way to start out the bad guy side of my daughters collection she loves having him and the mousers invade the sewer looking to beat up leonardo and raphael because leo sucks and raphs mean to mikey|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to like about this version of fett the sculpt is phenomenal and the articulation allows you to place him in a variety of poses unfortunately the paint gets a bit sloppy something ive noticed on a lot of the  figures on mine there was a large wallop of silvery paint on the black glass of fetts helmet i painted over it myself with glossy black paint but its still something that should never have gotten past quality control id warn buyers to try to find this figure in a retail store first and inspect him carefully in order to get a good sample aside from that hassle its a great figure|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|leia is definitely the weakest figure in wave  of the star wars  line but that doesnt mean shes a bad figure on my figure the face paint is cleanly applied and the plastic skin looks realistic its actually not a bad likeness of carrie fisher for me the biggest problem is the glaring knee joints which undermine the sculpt if you can get her on sale shes definitely a worthwhile addition to your collection|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|ive been skeptical of the  line of figures especially the humans with painted skin however i think hasbro really stepped up its game with this han solo this figure came out wonderfully the paint job frequently sloppy on the  line looks pretty good its not perfect and youll probably want to inspect a few in retail stores to choose the best but there are relatively few quality control issues hasbro also provided us with generous accessories including an extra set of gloved hands and two belts and two guns its nice to have customization options overall this could easily become my favorite of the  line thus far|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|unlike other reviewers i have this figure already i love the idea of a  stormtrooper but i was very disappointed with it hasbro clearly just recycled the body of the excellent  sandtrooper figure this means that its neck is too long the sandtrooper had a longer neck because its helmet sat on top of a pauldron however on the stormtrooper it just makes him look like a giraffe the helmet should sit much closer to the figures torso for such an expensive figure id at least have hoped hasbro would gotten the basics right as it stands id pass on buying this figure until hasbro fixes this mistake|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|theres a lot to like about this figure the body sculpt is spot on but the face doesnt capture mark hamils likeness the biggest problem is that its just too long also the paint application on some of the figures really misses the mark including paint that doesnt even cover the eyes correctly id really recommend against getting this online without inspecting it in a store first|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this figure might be controversial as the prequel films arent really the favorite of most collectors but i for one am glad we got a prequel era jedi in the line its a pretty simple figure but generally works the jedi outfit is sculpted with nice texture simulating the feel of clothhowever this figure gets knocked down several stars because of what its missing first theres no robe the brown robes were an essential part of the jedi garb note you can buy custom robes on ebay for a reasonable price but hasbro should have included one for the price its charging second the arm articulation is pretty limited especially at the elbow joints to the point where its very difficult to get the figure to hold his lightsaber with two hands finally the paint application on the face on some samples is very sloppy  be sure to inspect the figures before you buy themtheres a lot i like about this figure and im glad i got him but im frustrated that hasbro is charging so much for this line and not delivering the goods id recommend waiting until the figure goes on sale before getting him|ham
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|id been skeptical of hasbros  line but this greedo figure shows the lines true potential its got all of the great articulation weve come to expect from the  line what really struck me is the weathering and detail in the pain applications greedos outfit looks appropriately grungy and used its the type of detail hasbro cant possibly fit in the   line definitely one of the highlights of the line thus far|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|pablojill is probably the best figure of this wave of star wars figures hes an odd looking jedi and has quite an ugly face hasbro really gave him a lot of articulation including balljointed hips and rocker ankles the figure is a bit tough to stand up when his legs are close together so it might help if you use a stand despite that definitely one of the best prequel jedi figures|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this is the definitive luminara the outfit looks wonderful the black robes are wrinkled and frayed looking very used my only complaint is that the head piece is a bit loose if you play with your figures expect it to fall off frequently for collectors this is a must for any fan of prequel jedi|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|this mara figure has gotten a lot of flack on the internet for her hairdo her hair while well sculpted sits high on her head and looks puffy a very s style a lot of those concerns are warranted but there are also a lot of positive points to this figuremara has a lot of articulation including ankle waist and even torso more importantly unlike the recent padme figure the elbow joints are molded in flesh color so theyre very well hidden i think hasbro did a great job with her face and facial features except her eyebrows which are a bit too bigthe accessories are great she comes with a purple lightsaber not red as in the photo unlit hilt blaster and blaster holster the holster can be attached to her hip or her back i love that we get a choiceoverall i wish hasbro had gotten the hair down right but i dont think that ruins the figure this is definitely the best version of mara jade thus far but theres also a lot of room for improvement|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our grandson had been really looking forward to the arrival of the sodor search  rescue playset and getting harold captain butch flynn rocky  belle out of his makeshift barracks for them and into their own home  while the real sodor search  rescue center has a landing pad for harold a shed for rocky and a dock for captain this playset doesnt  but our grandson got creative and added to it with his legos  our first impression was that it was another great colorful playset with nice attention to detail and it is bright blue green  red along with the majority of the track in silvergrey and a goldish base to the centre itself  the centre is tierd the top tier has sodor search and rescue printed in red above a red paintedon door the ssrc emblem above one of  windows on one side plain light grey on the other side with  windows and with a green portion of track running through it that folds out into a downward incline and connects to the silver track  in has a lever that you lift to send flynn included down the track to put out two fires which are supposed to flip down as he passes by them  the bottom tier of the centre has another paintedon red door on one side and the inside has painted on search  rescue type of equipment ladders fire extinguishers an alarm bell axes hoses first aid kits and  shelves underneath a sign that says supplies holding oxygen masks search lights firehats etc  you can connect it to other sets or track at two points coming out of the centre itself and at the end of the silver track loop  unfortunately the downward incline isnt steep enough to give flynn the momentum he needs to round the curve and put out both fires  not a big deal  our grandson didnt mind pushing flynn  or others  along  this set made its debut on the  collector checklist  we paid  for our grandsons which seemed decent especially since our order qualified for the free shippingupdate  there are  playsets in the tnp line as of summer  that fall into what ive come to categorize as an intermediate range of between  and they are in order of introduction  cranky at the docks tidmouth sheds knapford station knapford holiday celebration sodor steamworks repair shed sodor search  rescue center twist  tumble cargo drop thomas treasure hunt adventure thomas shark exhibit paxton at the blue mountain stone shed and arctic exhibit  the great thing about these sets and those i categorize as basic with under  msrps is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets and even the intermediate sets relatively so and take them with us on excursionsa little of our own thomas history as first time grandparents my husband and i wanted to start some type of collection for our grandson that he could possibly pass along to his own kids one day  our grandson was   at the time and had been talking a lot about a certain train named thomas a little fella whom  now seems hard to believe  wed never heard of  after doing some research it seemed the takenplay line might be the perfect investment to engage and encourage his active imagination as well as provide a fun way for us to interact with him  what a rewarding decision weve had so much fun together with this quality line of trains vehicles and playsets  hes now  and a large portion of our basement has become a wonderful sodor land of make believe that we all enjoy visiting  and continues to hold his interest which is quite a feat given the tendency at that age to move in and out of toy phases so quickly  his little brother is now  year old and will be growing into them soon|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|my daughter loves thomas and has many of the wooden train cars so we were very excited to open this toy it was very easy  for an adult  to put together however the nature of the tracks will make it difficult or even impossible for a young child to put together unless they have memorized how to do it an adult without even seeing the photo could put the tracks together properly just by process of eliminationthe tracks make a loop and the enclosed thomas train goes around the loopthere are several stops that thomas can make along the way and by pressing the buttons on the top of the train you can choose where he will go how does thomas know where to go the peripheral snapon pieces on the side of the tracks interact with the engine which means that if the yrold wanders off with the loading station piece thomas wont be stopping thereone great thing about this toy is that thomas never falls of the tracks  hes on there pretty good and just goes around and around as many times as you likethomas also talks which is really pretty neat but my daughter was a bit put off by that if you have a kid who isnt crazy about talking toys like both of mine this version of thomas wont go over wellone aspect of this toy which was not surprising but still annoying is that none of the other thomas brand toys we have will work with this setobviously the small wooden trains wont fit on the track but even the larger plastic trains we have in our collection are not the same size either i dont see as where you can purchase other trains for this setoverall it was a fun toy that the children played with for some time its unwieldy to store of course but thats the very nature of train sets i wouldnt imagine kids older than  or  would have much interest in this toy unless they were dyedinthewool thomas fans|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|if youve ever had a tie interceptor toy know that hasbro has learned from its past releases and made the best version ever for the vintage release the cockpit is very intricate you can actually fit the pilot in and have him grab the steering yokes there is a lot of detailing overall a great vehicle if you can get it on sale which happens regularly for this vehicle definitely pick it upfor collectors who care about the box i checked the gift option during checkout and the box came in mint condition|spam
A3EK1BZAWAHEYU|the tie interceptor in return of the jedi moved too fast and was piloted by pilots with no skill so you may not fully appreciate them however as you see the toy you realize how beautiful it is  it is about  cm long and  cm wide so open some space on the shelfthe cockpit interior is nicely detailed  it does not have a removable seat like the tie bomber but you really may not care  walls look very movie accurate if you compare with the traditional tie fighter interior in episode iv  the drivers wheel is big and makes it look as if the pilot was piloting a big motorcycle which may not be too practical but cool  the external details match very much the model that appears in the  disc bluray editioni would have followed the traditional pros and cons structure but i realized that i have no cons  well it has nothing electrical but most of fighters do not have anything electrical so who cares  as usual with hasbro star wars fighters it requires some effort to make action figures to get inside tight cockpitsi have heard that tie fighters have a problem with wings bending but this one does not have that even if wings can be detached with a button in each side  with the tie bomber there were noremovable wings so this is a plus for me  the functionality it has is that cockpit opens and wings detachwhen i got vaders advanced tie fighter i saw that cockpit had some open spaces so dust could enter this is not the case of tie interceptor as it used a clear plastic that was painted so no dust would get inside the cockpiti can say it may not be the greatest toy of all but it was better than i expected just my opinion and it looks very cool something you cant appreciate in the movie as they move too fast|spam
AQZH7YTWQPOBE|update apparently some of the wings on the slave  ship dont lock appropriately in flight mode theres a pretty simple fix i posted a link in the comments sectioni remember getting the old versions of slave  back during the mids they were great for the time but in retrospect pretty poor quality the ship was always too narrow and the proportions distortedit took  years but we finally have a slave  vehicle that looks just like the version boba fett drove in empire strikes back this is a beautiful ship the base is based on the clone wars jango fett slave  which was painted blue this one is painted with esbaccurate colors and even includes the detailed color patterns on the hull and a detailed control panel inside the cockpitmy only complaint is the missilefiring guns i hate when hasbro adds these springlaunching missiles to vehicles they look tacky and barely work ive never met a single person who liked them and i detested them when i was a kid when you remove the missiles the guns still look movieaccurate but they should be there in the first placeive seen a lot of complaints about the value and price i think were all going to have to accept that prices have gone up its nice to see that unlike with the figure line quality has also gone up the price isnt great but its acceptable and well worth it for fans of fettdefinitely recommended after this ship i dont think hasbro will ever need to make another slave  againupdate some fans are upset about the packaging being damaged honestly i dont care about the packaging so i didnt mention it but unfortunately amazon shipped this without a box so if you want a pristine package you probably wont get it major faux pas on amazons part but again it didnt really affect my enjoyment of it some people have said if you order it as a gift amazon will take greater care in the packaging|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|remember the first shredder figure that came out  years ago he looked pretty freakin cool came with all kinds of extra weapons and he even had a real cloth cape  out of  shredder owners would end up with a naked shredder because somehow that stupid cape would always come off and get lost similar to splinters robe here we are many years later and theres still a cape problem the difference is that this one has a different issue and shredder himself looks so cool that even if you ditch the cape it doesnt really matter just look at this guy put him next to the old shredder and unless og shred blinds this new one with his pale chest and gets in a sucker punch its a nocontest this one is practically super shredder from the second turtles movieshredder  as hes known on this product page was a gift for my daughter at her birthday party this past weekend she only had two other badguys snakeweed and the mousers but was hoping to get the first version soon as cool as that one is this ones a step up they have very similar sculpts bladed shin guards shoulder armor and plated thigh guards and the chest plate i like that these pieces of armor arent just one smooth piece but are made up of multiple pieces of metal to give it a more armored look shredders helmet in this version also seems to be identical to the first versions only this time its removable and reveals his messed up dome this is one of the big differences between the two figures along with the much bigger blades on his gauntlets and the new removable cape overall i have no complaints at all when it comes to how he looks this is a great looking figure and a big step up from the old shredder figures he actually looks menacing here shred head also has some decent articulation at the neck shoulders wrists waist thighs and knees his left hand is also open so you can give him an extra weaponthe one thing keeping this figure from being  stars in my book is the cape it looks terrific with a weathered appearance and inserts via a peg into a hole in his back this is a great way to ensure that it stays on however the problem is that the parts that go on his shoulders constantly push his helmet off both sides of the cape that rest on his shouldersaround his neck go under the helmet because of how his shoulder armor is and because the cape is made of a thick flexible plasticthese sections can easily push the helmet off it takes a bit of futzing to get them to stay aside better if you remove the cape or helmet though theres no problemas it is this is still a rad figure thats sure to make playtime with the turtles even better|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|when i was younger i read a book called the indian in the cupboard in which a magical cupboard could make toys come to life i was surprised to find out that neca also apparently has such a cupboard that can shrink real people down into action figures apparently somebody at neca captured arnold schwarzenegger dressed him up as he appeared in predator and forced him into the cupboard neca then put arnold in a little plastic bubble and shipped him to my houseyou can imagine my horror when i opened this box i thought i was getting an action figure based on the character dutch from predator i didnt think id actually get arnold himself i understand that some people might be upset at arnold because he had an affair and an illegitimate child however thats no reason to condemn the man to live the rest of his life as an action figure if i were a better person id try to find a way to free arnold but im not arnold happens to be just the right size for my neca predator figures so im keeping him on my shelfi noticed that neca cloned arnold and is now selling more of these as figures dont be fooled  this isnt an action figure its a miniaturized version of arnold himself if your conscience is not bothered by owning a real person shrunk down to  inches then by all means get this but be warned  every once in a while youll swear that arnolds beady eyes are looking at you in contempt as if hes about to say who the f are you|spam

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|i always felt the best figure interpretation of the black adam has been the from the democrat hands of alex ross in the justice line upon getting this new  black adam figure my opinion like elbows and kneecaps remains the sameneedless to say i still purchased the figure at my local comic shop it was not until i got home that i realized how little i liked the figure  hindsight it  but i wish that i had not been in such a rush while at the store so i would have had more time to carefully evaluate the figure to determine whether or not is was worth the purchase or notmy grandmother drove me to the comic shop and was honking her horn relentlessly to hurry up to make matters worse i had drunk far too much rootbeer the store owner doesnt let anyone use the store restroom for one reason or another so i had to wait till i got to the fabric store with my grandmother before i could go she was in a rush to pick up more fabric for the george zimmerman christmas musical her church group is performing this year at the parade childrens academyas for the sense of design of the characters costume it is difficult to relate to either on one end with the justice version there is a grown man in tights with broad open collar and freeflowing sash that appears as if he just left jazz dance class with the  version there is a greater sense of flair in the liberace wardrobe dropout complete with dramatic high collar cape and even louder boots failure to mention the attention driven compensating size of the belt would be criminalbeing the archnemesis black adam is to shazam one cant help but wonder why the obsession perhaps the inner child of shazam is what appeals to black adam seems to me he may need to register as a sex offender now or take his alluring sense of style to the stage|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|my daughter is almost  years old and shes had a fascination with the bow since she was  she saw me my brother and my dad all shooting a target with various bows and got to try a little bow that she could pull back when she hit the haystack with that little pink bow its all she could talk about for the rest of the day and since then archery has started to make a real comeback when you look at movies brave the hunger games and the avengers have really gotten kids interested in the weapon again when we saw the rebelle bow and crossbow at the store a few months agoto say that my daughter was excited would be an understatement she already loved nerf guns and now there was a nerf bow its like they read her mind yesterday she got it as one of her presents along with the crossbow and it was the one thing she brought along to family gettogethersthe heartbreaker bow is an awesome toy it has a little ammo rack mounted on the top that holds  dartsarrows insert one of them into the hole that it shoots out of pull the bow string back and let go the overall design of the toy is great and apart from the usual concern with the string snapping if misused there isnt much to be worried about the darts are easy to find despite not being the usual boring orange color this is a solid durable piece of plastic that feels just as sturdy as your average nerf gun its also bigger than you might think even after seeing it in the stock pictures i got my daughter the cool phoenix design and there are several other styles available nowat first i was worried the bow barely shot the darts  feet after trying out the rebelle guardian crossbow which shot them out at incredible speeds and  great distances this was a huge letdown over the course of the day i kept trying to get it to fire properly and i eventually figured that something inside had broken but after a few consecutive tries i figured it out pulling the string back all the way even with the dart inserted properly doesnt fire the ammo very far you have to pull it back just a tiny bit further and youll hear a sound that lets you know its ready to fire once you realize this and test it out everything is fine its worth mentioning unless we just got a defective modelthe rebelle heartbreaker definitely gets my daughters approval and mine too its fun and is one of the few girly nerf toys out there she may be a tomboy and is fine with regular nerf guns but its nice that theyre finally making an effort to go in another direction with their products|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|just when you think theyre done putting out cool minecraft toys they go and release papercraft just a few months ago i woke up and went to the living room only to find a miniature minecraft farm on the floor i stared at it for a few seconds trying to figure out if these were new toys or something since they look just like the figures that have been coming out i was happy to see that they werent figures in the traditional sense but papercraft animals papercraft has really taken off over the last  years going from files you had to print out and hope you didnt mess up for fear of wasted ink to books and sets like this you can just go and buy at any store my daughter got this animal mobs set and enjoyed it so much that she wants to get a few others nowin the animal mobs set here you get  pigs  chickens  ocelots  cows  sheep  grass blocks and  stickers thats a good amount of stuff for the price simply pop the characters out of their paper sheets and start folding with how basic the minecraft designs are its simple to understand what needs to be folded where everything looks perfect too the animals all look great as do the grass blocks its kinda hard to mess up designs that are made up of squares though if your child is having a minecraft themed birthday party buying a couple of these or the other sets would make for a fantastic activity for the kids to doit may not take that long to put together but this is the kind of thing id hope most parents can get behind your kids will have fun putting together the little animals and can recreate their game worlds in real life with just about any other minecraft figures the scale on these guys is nice allowing them to fit in with the plastic figures and even the keychain hangers the paper quality is pretty thick so they should hold up for quite some time none of them have any noticeable problems staying assembled either if you havent done papercraft before sometimes your creation will start to unfold over time for a number of reasonstheres nothing bad i can say about this set theyre really going all out with minecraft products lately aside from the poorly lit redstone ore ive yet to see anything disappointing when it comes to the minecraft toys heres hoping for a papercraft ender dragon|spam

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|my recommendation for this set depends quite a bit on the price i bought it during a massive sale and got it for the price of about a figure and a half at that price its a steal however i wouldnt pay too much for the set unfortunately its filled mostly with repacks or slight variations granted all of the figures are well made and have solid paint applications so if you dont have three or more of the characters in this set this would be a great way to get themhowever theres nothing truly exciting here except possibly dookus droid fa which is the only truly allnew figure sun fac received some new joint articulation but honestly the  figure still holds up pretty well and this release doesnt include his staff the clone troopers helmet is a bit too big for his body a problem that plagues clone troopers in the hasbro line the battle droid sandtrooper and tie pilot are all great if you need more of those most collectors probably dont the bonus droid is tc  great paint job but not the most exciting droid he was jabbas droid in the clone wars movieoverall my recommendation would be to keep an eye on this and look out for sales|spam

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|when i saw these at the ny toy fair when they premiered i immediately recognized the problem some people will have with her you have to sit her down first to get her ready to flip  that means you can use the whole body to easily push the leg springs in place  whereas if you push her backbutt down its much harder to get those springs in placethis is from the rainbow power line of ponies and has her special rainbow power wings as seen in the last episode of this season as well she has the decals for the special rainbow power symbols in the showrainbow dash is the fastest horse in equestria and so she gets the flipping motion i think shes good for a few times fun but my daughter an avowed rainbow pony fan did get bored of her pretty fast  once the flipping motion gets old then you can push her cutie mark to get phrases  but the phrases all relate to her jumping which is an annoyance after the flipping action gets oldif your child loves mlp they are going to want this and theres very little you can say to dissuade them shes the only pony on the market that really does some kind of action  but also keep in mind that she is larger than the other ponies and so doesnt play well in sets|ham

A2WW57XX2UVLM6|i have a little girl who loves to style dolls so this is perfect for her  this is a larger size than the regular playsetsized  ponies so she wont be useable in the train air balloon helicopter or castles rather shes meant for fashion play of brushing and styling the hair and playing with her little rabbit friend  there are several ponies this size and they are great for smaller kids with smaller hands  especially if you have a little one who could spend hours brushing or styling hairfluttershy comes with hairclips rabbit friendand comb  there are other fluttershy ponies available in the  size at about half the price so you may want to consider those first they are vanilla and dont come with accessories  yes you are paying more for a larger pony and accessories that you wont find on the smaller ones  but for many kids thats really worth it also note that there is a friendship is magic  version that comes with a cape  that is an older pony and you may disappoint if you dont bring home a rainbow power fluttershythe reason to get this rainbow power version pony over the friendship is magic version is because she has been given the rainbow power treatment  extra decals on the haunches and rainbow power color in her hair  this transformation of the regular fluttershy into this more magical version occurred at the tv series season ender in may of  so most kids really want this updated more magical version of fluttershy  if your child doesnt watch the tv series then you may want to get the older fluttershy without the special decals on the side but which comes with a cape and shoesin all a lovely larger version great for little hands who like to style and brush|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|at first glance i would have thought seoni was a druid  im not entirely sure why this is but it might have something to do with the flowing attire and staff shes wielding  wielding a staff usually the figure is a caster but since she doesnt  have a broadbrimmed hat or flowing robes druid seems like the next logical choice  no matter bob ridolfis sculpt follows wayne reynolds war art closely although in fact shes in a far more dynamic than warsas always war has a lot of sleeves that cover wrists and ankles and seem impractically attached  this isnt obvious when seoni stands still but in a pose like this miniature it looks like her clothes might just slough off her any seconddespite those quibbles seonis pose makes her an interesting miniature that stands out from the typical sorceresses and druid types|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|simply put this is the best toy to come out of the spiderman toy flood from this year its affordable is a spiderman toy thats actually an alternate take on a nerf gun and will definitely provide the user with hours and hours of fun there are a few little drawbacks that keep it from being a real home run but its miles ahead of the dumb spiderman motorcycles that are still on clearance shelves as i type this reviewoverall the web blaster toy is solidly built and doesnt feel cheap it features an adjustable strap so nearly anyone can wear it comfortably this could be an error of some kind but i like that the toy doesnt operate unless the disc hatch is closed completely you have to click it in place for it to be closed all the way and if its not the toy wont work even when switched on pop open the tray and you can insert  of the foam discs turn it on and the motor will start up immediately waiting for you to blast whatever you want the discs shoot very quickly but dont hurt even if youre hit at close rangethe coolest thing about this toy at least in my eyes is that the discs can shoot more than  feet maybe its just me being used to disappointing toys from when i was little where the commercial would show a dart gun shooting super far only to find out that it goes maybe  feet shootingtype toys are great now and this is no exception my eyes got big when i saw the web blaster in action for the first time kids will not be disappointed with it at allthere are a couple of drawbacks to this otherwise rad toy one of which most parents wont be a fan of theres no other way to put it the motor is just plain annoyingly loud it sounds like a small vacuum or blender and if your child isnt told to turn it off after the discs are shot it could go through batteries like theyre nothing just remind the user that this thing uses batteries and to turn it off when its not going to be shooting anything and they should be fine the other negative is that it only holds  discs at a time fortunately it comes with  discs but with how fast this thing shoots them itd be great to be able to shoot all  or even more within a few seconds oh well i guess thats what the bigger nerf guns are forperfect for any spiderman fan especially the little ones that cant quite handle a big nerf gun yet this web blaster would be a big hit with the little web slinger in your life|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|sculptor jeff grace has created a technically accurate female elf  from there things are a little sketchy shes wielding a crooked wooden staff which looks more like a branch and pushes autumn from wizard to druid  also lets be honest a name like autumn bronzeleaf practically screams druidtitles aside autumns just resting with her wooden staff she doesnt believe in wearing a lot of clothes either but casters can get away with thati painted autumn blonde only now does it occur to me that maybe i should have painted her hair an autumn color and used woodland green tones for what little attire she has|spam

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|it really says something about how strong a dart gun is when grown adults who get hit by it say ouch every timeoriginally my daughter just wanted the rebelle crossbowbut then she saw the bow powerbelle blaster smaller guns and everything else the bow and crossbow are both excellent nerf products but this sucker right here is the real deal the commercial for the powerbelle doesnt get the point across that this gun is very powerful it uses the same darts as the other rebelle guns and bows which are basically the same as most nerf guns but its the motor that packs a punch look above at the product description and youll see that the powerbelle can shoot up to  feet im happy to say that this is true you have to see the gun in action for yourself to understand why its so popular it shoots hard fast and fires  darts before it has to be reloaded make the most of any nerf war and carry extra ammo with you while using this thing and youre set to plow through everyone that gets in your way even my  year old brother thinks its cool and is considering getting one for himself i said it before with the rebelle bow its about freakin time that girls started to get some serious artillerythe single downside to the powerbelle is that the motor is loud theres no chance of anyone pulling off a sneak attack in a quiet area or most areas for that matter unless a tv or something is cranked up its a small price to pay for unloading ten darts on some poor unsuspicting victim the gun is well made but anyone using it should be careful not to drop it the plastic could crack if dropped on a hard floor or something inside could come loose and ruin the shooting altogether make use of the strapas much as she loves the crossbow and bow the powerbelle quickly became my daughters favorite gun i still remember how shocked i was when she shot me for the first time with it it packs a wallop thats for sure i also have to recommend using some of those cool rebelle protective glasses if you go up against someone with this gun dart guns can be dangerous but this takes it to another level and if someone got shot in the eye with it it would definitely hurt aside from the noise factor theres nothing bad to say about the powerbelle its a great gun thats going to get plenty of use over the next couple of years|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|ive often criticized werner klockes sculpts for being too stripperific with busty females wearing impractical armor that guarantees theyll get skewered through their exposed breastbone  but isabeau laroche is here to dispel any misconception about klockes ability  if he wants to sculpt a sensibly armed and armored warrior woman ms laroche proves it can be donewith a large shield on one hand and a massive sword in the other laroche could be any female fighter  the best part about her is that she has her hair sensibly up in a bun with a single braid on one side of her head thats it  no flowing hair for enemies to grab no midriff baring armor to make it easier for villains to stab and she even has sensible armor and a cloak covering her buttif theres a flaw theres little about laroche to distinguish her as a paladin  she lacks herr klockes typical flourishes that give each character their individuality like a theme sculpted on her armor and weapons  still while laroche may not be the best choice for a paladin shes an excellent sculpt for a sensible warrior who just happens to be female|spam
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|its odd that werner klockes sculpt is called a crusader  finari is clearly a paladin  certainly more paladin than isabeau in finaris case her paladin symbol is a crosslet  a cross that ends in a smaller cross on each arm  the crosslet is a symbol of the arms of beauchamp  finari has them on her shield her shoulders her gauntlets even her boots her swords hilt has the same crosslet pattern  when finari takes on a style she really commitsthis is what reaper has to say about finarione of the rare women among the justicars and also one of the youngest to achieve that rank finari seems to feel that she has something to prove her voice is often raised against those of her elders questioning or challenging but she speaks with intelligence and her astute observations are welcome it is often wished however that her contributions were not delivered by such a very sharp tonguenonetheless in battle finari is a steadfast foe of evil and her ruthless dispatching of the enemy is almost as efficient as sir brannors indeed in a rare show of humor the sergeant once issued a challenge and now he and finari often fight side by side in the field competing to see how many black souls they can send to deaths gates though leadership is not her forte finaris skill and fervor do inspire her fellow templars to hold the line no matter what horrors the enemy sends against themwell now im really confused  is finari a justicar a templar a paladin or a crusaderher hair is still a little too long for combatreadiness but not so long that its ridiculous for a paladin who prides herself in her appearance finaris haughty stance as she peers down her nose at an opponent unworthy of her time positions her as a great paladin  or justicar or templar etc or at least one familiar to adventuring parties everywhere|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|one of the brilliant things about bobby jacksons elf sculpts is that they dont look like humans with pointed ears this dark elf warrior is part of a line of longlimbed drow  their armor is full of flourishes with plenty of leather wraps this theme will continue with the entire dark elf line in this case the aforementioned warrior has two angular short swords at the readyi painted all the drow using a mixture of shades of purple white hair and black skin  its difficult to paint leather straps on characters like this without some of the tools the professionals use so i rely primarily on shading to make up the differencealthough this miniature can really be for any elf the longlimbed proportions are in line with other elf sculpts from reaper its a great sculpt for any drow|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|we discontinued a  year takenplay collection at the end of  due to decreasing quality issues but  for the most part  the playsets have not with a few exceptions gone south as dramatically as the actual trainsvehicles which they still claim are diecast but feel completely plastic other than for their magnetic connectors  this one is actually pretty clever with diesel included set to work at the oil yard  we like how one side allows him to descend inclines that can connect up to other playsets or track at  different points while the other has him descending down into a track area thats supposed to be the dieselworks though in this case the places to connect are lifted off the ground  the main idea behind the takenplay concept was ease of transportation and this one serves that purpose well with diesel and the snapin oil attachment fitting securely inside when closed along with a handle to carry it  amazons current  price is decent given the  msrp though where the msrp was set is debatableif the little person in your life is just getting into thomas you might like to know what other sets are available in the under  msrp range from prior to   they were  the original version of the toteatrain playbox colin at the wharf thomas at the farm percys mail delivery tidmouth tunnel toby at trotters farm sir handel at great waterton sodor engine wash talking diesels fuel  freight delivery sodor paint shop around the rails with thomas muddy adventure go go speedy railway sodor lumber company treasure tracks a new version of the toteatrain playbox brendam docks and sodor spiral run the only ones we really would recommend staying away from are go go speedy railway the new version of toteatrain and sodor spiral run  there were also a few extra low cost sets thomas portable set percy portable set  diesel portable set that equated to extranofrills that we werent at all impressed with  so far in  weve heard about whiffs banana blooper stanleys construction clash bashs tree tumble saltys flip  switch track dashs criss cross diesels double delivery and scrapyard cleanup team  this group of sets are definitely the simplest for a youngster to take n play with|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|theres two things that should make this set awesome monster trucks and a giant robot combining the two so that the monster truck attacks the giant robot should be icing on the cake unfortunately it isnt quite as tasty a cake as it could befor one this is part of the track builder hot wheels set but its not entirely compatible  oh sure you could connect other sets to this one but it becomes apparent that the killer robot known as maxd is no slouch  in essence the monster truck is so large that its wheels fill up an entire track taking up the space of two cars  the truck is manually launched with a lever that fires it towards maxd who is made up of three pieces a pair of legs a torso with two claw arms that can hold a car in each hand and a head  all three of these separate if the chest plate is hit hard enough separating maxd in a satisfying springloaded explosion of robobody parts the key is hard enoughnever mind that if you connected this set to the other sets the cars dont have enough mass to trigger maxd  they also rarely hit him in the right place  but that wouldnt be a problem if at least the monster truck triggered the explosion  it doesnt  my sixyearold couldnt ever get it to work after multiple tries and it took me another  attempts before i was able to hit maxd where it hurts  in short theres not much in the way of maximum destructionthe other problem is that maxd doesnt sit well on his dirtplatform hes frequently falling over  my kids were eager to play with him but quickly discovered that punching him in the chest plate hurts maxds legs dont move so he pretty much sits there  the clawgrasping action is cool but the two flimsy props a crunched up bus and a dumpster are poor substitutes for other cars in his fistsmaxd and the monster truck are fun separately but their collision is less exciting than the promise on the box|ham

A3F2VVIQIY6U64|it was only a matter of time before a new kind of monster high toy accessory came out over the last couple of years weve seen costumes stuffed animals purses makeup kits and more but now were moving on to another toy within the toy line secret creepers i hadnt even seen any of the toys until after we got this crypt which is kind of like a minidollhouse with how much you can put on itthere are a lot of things to talk about here the bottom line is that youre getting quite a bit for your money i was pleasantly surprised at just how much can go with this set tons of space for the different pets both new secret creepers and the original ones that come with the mh dolls details on certain parts like webs and hearts on the back of the spider are a nice touch and they even have a background that goes perfectly with jane boolittle theres a pink key thats made up of a chain and fish bones you can use this to open the main crypt making for a dramatic effect where the gate slowly comes down inside you can store a few pets or whatever you want its a fairly large compartment a green compact case is included and it also acts as a kind of stool for one of the pets to sit on when its not being used again i was surprised at how big this was when opened after being disappointed with the lack of space in a few mh doll accessories like folders and bags the ones that come with the dolls this was a nice step up the coolest part of the whole crypt however has got to be the red coffin couch under the cushion theres a little drawer that comes out and you can put something in it but with the flick of a switch on the back it hides what you put in there its a very neat trick and reminds me of a beetlejuice toy i had in the early sthe play set comes with one pet crescent the cat who acts as a guard for the dog housecrypt growling if anyone walks within  feet of it its nice to include a figure when they could have just sold the set on its own for the same price  lr batteries are included so youre ready to go right out of the boxfor about the price of a monster high doll youre getting a pretty cool play set for the new pets though it goes with the girls and boys just as well too any monster high fan will love this just be prepared to watch the dollars disappear as you get more and more pets|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|im not a big fan of card games but the steampunk setting appealed to me  when i got the game i tested it out with my sixyearold son too young for the recommended age but a fun opportunity to bond over the game  normally when we play these games once or twice but we played koryo over a dozen times and each game we learned a little more about how it workskoryo is based on a steampunk setting with different families who are each responsible for different aspects of commerce  there are priests merchants politicians and broadcasters who presumably are the morse code equivalents of internet bloggers there are also two types of event cards which inflict damage on an opponent barbarians and uprisingswhat makes koryo so elegant is how selfcontained it all is  there are eight seasons turns so the game has a finite end and this changes the players tactics as they start out maneuvering against each other and then in the final season scramble for influence  each season the number of cards in a players hand decreases and the number of cards in play increases which forces players to be judicious with the application of the cards they use in the gamethe influence of any particular card is determined by whoever has the majority of that card out at one time this is particularly important in two player games where it might not be enough to have just one card out since the other player can easily counter by having his own card in play cancelling each other out theres even a card the omniscient who exists specifically to break these sorts of tiesevery card has a number associated with it and at the end of the game the points are tallied  event cards have a negative number which means that any player using these cards to harm his opponent is potentially doing himself a disservice at the end game tally bankers can also accumulate coins which add to the final point tally and spies can steal them  the player with the most points influence winsour only issue with koryo is that theres not enough cards in the later turns which makes it difficult to easily shuffle themthis is a surprisingly elegant game that is much more complex than it appears  with beautiful art a quick resolution and so many possible outcomes its great fun thats multiplied by the number of players|spam

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|until recently the modern sheriff archetype was more associated with sheriff andy taylor of the andy griffith show than the zombie apocalypse  but then the walking dead came along and sheriff rick grimes changed everything  okay so this is deputy wayne tisdale not sheriff wayne tisdale but you get the ideatheres not too much about tisdale that makes him a modern sheriff he could fit in just about anywhere with the exception of the walkietalkie strapped to his belt just about any modern game thats not in an urban area could use a miniature like thisjokes on us though  although you might think tisdale is based off of more recent sheriff archetypes the sheriff looks a lot like this guy aka boss hogg  which makes tisdale rosco purvis coltrane  so by all accounts it looks like reaper decided to market tisdale separately from his fatter companion and voila instant zombie action hero  context is everything|ham
A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|if you know the resident evil film franchise then youve already met bonnie  her name is alice  given that reaper decided to produce gears of warstyle miniature and a variety of zombie apocalypse survivors its inevitable that bonnie would eventually show up after all whats a zombie apocalypse without a hot cloned babe to start dualgunning her way through hordes of the undeadbonnies loaded for bear with two blades strapped to her back shoulder holsters for two pistols and a submachinegun in each hand  her wrists are wrapped in some kind of cloth and her jeans are cuffed tightly above her knees shes moving fast too with one foot off the ground  and thats where reaper bones gets messyreapers bonesium is awesome for storing miniatures painting miniatures and if youre anything like me frequently dropping miniatures  what its not great is providing a strong structural framework for miniatures  bonnies one flimsy leg is not enough to keep her upright and even if you do manage to straighten her out using the boiling waterfreezing cold technique shes just going to get warped again from rough handlingbonnies a decent choice for a zombie game but not so great in bonesium|ham

AQZH7YTWQPOBE|there are a lot of problems with this figure but despite that i love it playmates released pictures of a prototype with much better paint applications the picture shown on amazons page but the final product still works heres the rundowngood great head sculpt the head really looks like an angry warthog i love how the two tusks stick far out above the lip the articulation works well and the head has a surprising range of movementbad the paint application is pretty basic theres no weathering on the figure i think that generally works for a cartoony figure with a few exceptions the spikes on the spike bracelets are left in the original molded black not painted silver bebops glasses are purple rather than blue like in the original cartoon the bod proportions are topheavy bebops upper arms and chest and head are just too big for his relatively scrawny legs theres no ankle articulation so your options in posing him are pretty limitedoverall this figure along with rocksteady is a bit of a letdown compared to last years tmnt classics figures but its is still worth getting for fans of bebop in the  tmnt cartoon compared to the rocksteady figure this one is of better quality overall but i think playmates made some design choices that just dont sit well with me|spam

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|indeed i picked up this figure up for my sonhe is a huge wonder woman fan i do not use the word huge lightly hehhis mother was a native of an island that i met while serving a mission for my churchat age five i had been left in a box on the doorstep of our mobile chapel  which was a rundown winnebago on cinder blocks next to the jiffy smart gas station and mini mart with some local cultrual crafts but mostly a liquor store from then on i was part of roughly fourteen members of our congregation here on the reservation in new mexico most of them were wellinto their golden years of life despite years of consistently heavy drinking since childhood such a lifestyle would of done most men or women in in fact most of the people in our congregation were only on disability and government assistance due to their age and the abundant amount of aid available to themour congregation always had trouble maintaining the numbers due to those who would visit us from the sourthern lands of no borders find our faith long enough to get a few free meals clothes money and then disappear again likely return home to their families and share our message of hope and change  lots of it when word got to one of the elders that there was an opening for a mission i was the obvious choice to be called on a mission due to my youthful disposition  they felt that with me being thirteen years of  age i would have the fortitude to handle he demands of a mission calling on a remote island filled with natural inhabitantsso for the next several months i earned money to pay for the mission by driving a school bus full of coyotes mostly kids at various pick up points along the fence and take them to the local agency to be processed into the country then i would take them to their new homes to enjoy the abundant benefits provided by our loving government meanwhile my congregation supported me in preparing for my mission by verbal platitudes most of them used the money i earned to buy scope mouthwashon my fourteenth birthday i left for the mission field no one was there at the bus station to see me off due to irregular drop offs of mail from passing freight ships it was approximately four months later while settled into my daily routine on the island proselytizing that i received contact from the members of my congregation the letter had been written just two days after i left they casually asked how things were going but went on and on as to all the help they needed and when i would be returning home with new recruitslittle did they know just how successful my efforts would bewhen i arrived by short boat to the port the special king of the tribe was there with many of his people to welcome me within a few moments into the celebration of my arrival i discovered something off about the tribe after years of no contact with the outside world the tribe was left to extensively practice inmarriage and breed this created an overspecialization within their gene pool offering little to no variationenter myselfthe special king immediately offered one of his although not very swift intellectually speaking they were exceptionally strong daughters to be my wife clair was by the island standards too old to marry being ten years older and a good foot and half taller than me the special king felt i was her last great chance as well as his the people of the island were beginning  to implode upon themselves and we could reverse that from happening it was clear that the purpose of my mission had been laid outimmediately we were married in what might be described by our cultural standards on the reservation as unconventional nevertheless it was common practice by this people so much so i am sworn to never divulge this much i will say my wifes sisters are very very strongseveral passed on the island andstay tuned for more|ham

A3CPJYAQMCUGNR|spending much of my youth in oregon my grandparents felt that it was important that i be active in school  sports and various other community events when opportunity arose my grandfather was an eagle scout thanks to a real bald eagle foot a native american friend of the family gave to him for his birthday truth be told he wasnt really a native american per say but was really a die hard washington dc redskins fan he was one of the fairest redheads id ever seen he had access to all sorts of wildlife at the archery shop he ranwith no scouting programs available in the area grandfather insisted that i be involved in similar activities to help my development as a substitution a popular camping program to teach life skills was run in our area by namblaa community outreach program of grown men many of whom just got out of prison actively engaged in the nurturing relationship of young boys  it was the perfect program for boys in search of good mentorship when they had no father figures in my case my grandfather due to his frail condition camping would have been far too much of a hardship on him besides he didnt want to miss back to back episodes of barney miller something he could not do with zero reception up in the mountains  it was his show that  he would watch regardless of where he was  one time grandmas bowels were acting up and she needed to be rushed to the hospital on the way to the hospital it hit seven oclock after frantically driving around downtown in the rain he pulled the car over and watched the show from the other side of the window of a closed television repair shopgrandma didnt make it that night but i tend to believe it that it was simply her time to goon one of the nambla campouts i became lost in the midnight game of pajama hide and seek the purpose was to pair the fathers up with the boys for the weekend  it was one of the more popular games since it involved pajamas but this particular night simply did not go well in fact because the boys outnumbered the fathers no one came looking for me that night as a result i spent the night lost in the woods and fell asleep by a fallen treesometimes i would hear footsteps or hear rapid heavy breathing but i did could not see anything i thought that it was a predator watching over me since they would not harm kidswhen i woke up in the morning it turned out i was only about thirty feet from the camp site but i simply did consider going in that direction  i thought the bright lights were for the dog kennel that was along the fence that surrounded our campsite those dogs scared me and i did not want to be near themwhat did happen was that the good men of nambla did in fact go looking for me that night but several of them became lost themselves and ended up sleeping in the woods or their vans to think of the sacrifices they made on my behalf really brought me comfort that morningi ended up going home that day fatherless but never forgetting the valuable lesson i learned from being lost  sometimes it is best to not give up so easily when it gets darkthis figure serves as a reminder of that frightful night spent alone in the woods while a mysterious predator watched over me|ham

A3PPXVR5J6U2JD|the first problem with any swarms in dungeons  dragons  is that they are all tenfeet square this means that all miniatures that are swarms are not as large as they should be because  the sculptor probably got tired and  its a solid mass of costly plasticmetal to create the miniature in short most miniatures fall far short of being suitable for use in ddthis spider swarm doesnt deviate from that formula  as a swarm its only inch but its filled with cute spiders of all sorts including one little spider piggybacking on a larger one  for a spider swarm its rather adorablenot particularly scary not the right size but a fun sculpt nonetheless|ham

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|harold the helicopter was always a big favorite of our  year old grandson during his thomas the train phase and that continued with the team lightning and dinoco helicopters when his interest swayed to disneys cars movies  then he got a glimpse of the three helicopters blade ranger windlifter and nick loopin lopez that will be in the planes sequel fire  rescue oh my gosh was he excited  grandpa pumped up the excitement level by scheduling a day off to see the movie with us on july th and itll be hard to keep all of the new diecast characters under wraps until christmas  we understand that blade ranger is a demanding nononsense boss in charge of piston peak air attack team and hes a little skeptical about his trainee main character dusty crophopper from the original planes movie  one neat feature is that his door slides open you can rotate the hoist and pull it out then spin the propeller to retract it and push it back in  amazons free shipping price as of today is way too high though walmart has him for  but even though its a deluxe model wed purchased all of the deluxe mattel  scale cars  diecasts for our grandson and the msrp was    ill definitely wait it out until i find him for a lower price since i have until christmaswe had a terrific experience with all of the deluxe cars  diecasts though mattels versions feels more like very sturdy plastic to us as compared to disney stores larger  scale models  we now have a  year old grandson as well who likes to get hold of big brothers toys and fling them around much to big brothers chagrin and that includes the diecast collection from the original planes movie from last christmas  not a single propeller has broken off despite that treatment  i cant begin to imagine the issues that would come up with disney stores versions which come in display cases and have a heavier metal concentration super cool to look at but the disney store versions of the cars  items we bought had spoilers etc popping off at the drop of a hat  since we have another grandson due to arrive around labor day durability is priority  for us  the toys we purchase will have to get through three boys before they eventually are handed down to our great grandchildren someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our older grandson has so thoroughly enjoyed his collections of mattels  scale diecasts starting with cars  and then planes and particularly endearing are all of the little forklift characters theyve developed  both our  year old and  year old grandsons will be standing in line with us on july th waiting for tickets to the planes sequel called fire  rescue and theyre so excited  we understand that maru is the sarcastic little mechanic at the piston peak air attack base  hes got quite a few miles under his belt and is quite adept at rooting through his cluttered hangar for parts  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a few days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick maru up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todayweve really been pleased with the quality of these diecasts super dooper sturdy and hold up well under all sorts of action including little brother sneaking one now and then and launching it like a grenade  its been a good investment especially now that weve got another grandson due in september wholl be enjoying them in a few years as well  we tried some of the larger  scale disney store diecasts they look great but our experience is that the higher metal concentration leads to pieces breaking off the first time they hit the floor  the mattel models feel more like a very durable plastic which is paramount when theyll need to survive three boys and maybe greatgrandchildren someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|as if just hearing about the planes sequel fire  rescue wasnt enough to fire up our  year old grandsons excitement level grandpa tells him hell take a day off on july th to go with us to see it on the big screen  its going to be hard as heck to keep all of these new diecast characters hidden away until christmas especially blackout and the rest of the smokejumpers leader dynamite pinecone avalanche and drip a ground crew thats transported via an exmilitary plane called cabbie and parachutes down to clear debris caused by wildfires  we hear that blackout whos equipped with a saw blade got his name after causing a weekslong blackout by accidentally sawing right through an electrical line not to mention interfering with his short term memory  we started collecting diecasts for our grandson when he was infatuated with thomas the train and have continued through his infatuations with cars and now planes  hes derived so much enjoyment from these mattel  scale versions and we look forward to seeing him introduce his new guys to the old guys later this year  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a few days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick blackout up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todayour main consideration with these collections has been the level of durability and these smaller mattel models as compared to the larger  scale disney store models have served us well  the heavier metal concentration of the disney store models made them awesome to look at but unless you decided to buy stock in super glue at the same time it was an exercise in frustration with all of the pieces that would come off at the drop of a hat  that wont fly here given we now also have a  year old grandson who seems to think the main purpose for toys is to employ them as projectiles  what we purchase needs to survive these two grandkids as well as another grandson wholl be arriving early september so the mattel models with more of a sturdy plastic feel are the right ones for us wed like to see our great grandkids play with them someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|grandpa  i get so tickled to see our  year old grandsons excitement over the prospect of grandpa taking a day off of work on july th to accompany us to the planes sequel called fire  rescue  hes enjoyed the cars and original planes movies so much as well as the diecasts weve collected for him  we understand pinecone is a member of the smokejumpers along with leader dynamite avalanche blackout and drip a ground crew thats transported via an exmilitary plane called cabbie and parachutes down to clear debris caused by wildfires  pinecone is an easygoing southern gal who has a handy rake and recalling how much our grandson loved a construction crew called the pack during his thomas the train phase i know this group of characters will become new favorites when christmas rolls around  we have the luxury of waiting for the price to come down  on amazon as of today closer to the  msrp these diecasts have had so well bide our time  i was at walmart a few days after writing this review and they were just putting up a fire  rescue display they didnt yet have pinecone but i was able to pick up  of the figures for just  a piece so thats where ill be getting the rest of his collection unless amazon comes way down in pricethe  scale mattel models have become our preference based on our experience over the past few years  they have more of a sturdy plastic feel and now that we have a  year old grandson as well who is a lot rougher on toys than our older one was durability is our primary consideration especially since we have another grandson making his debut around labor day with three boys to make it through and hopefully great grandchildren someday the toys we buy have to be tough  the disney store models weve purchased were larger  scale and had a heavier metal concentration but look out if they rolled off of the coffee table  parts were breaking off like crazy  the mattel collections have held their own|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|wed already purchased skipper as part of a collection of mattels  scale diecast characters from the original planes movie last christmas for our then  now  year old grandson and this one appears to be the exact same model hey why change a good thing huh skipper  skipper riley is an old navy fu corsair and former flying ace who was a recluse until he met dusty crophopper and became his mentor  hes based on the reallife wwii vf squadron known as the jolly rangers and in the movie he was the instructor of the elite jolly wrenches fighter jets very clever  hes a handsome shade of blue with white sporting the jolly wrenches insignia and the number  along with vf on the rear of his fuselage and were excited about seeing his reappearance when we all go to see the movie on july th  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a couple of days after i wrote this review they had skipper for   a much better price than amazons  price as of today and he looks exactly the same as the diecast from the original planes moviewe knew right away based on our great experience with our collection of the same scale of mattels cars  diecasts that wed want these for planes  super super durable  they feel more like a sturdy plastic than metal but thats what makes them hold up  wed purchased some of the larger  scale disney store models of cars  as well with their heavier metal concentration and attractive display cases  but the cases are where they shouldve stayed  they just dont hold up to the rigours of play pieces kept breaking off especially now that we have a  year old grandson in the picture as well who never met a toy he didnt like to throw  if we last as long grandpa  i would love to see these guysgals make it through  grandsons we have our rd due around labor day and into the hands of some great grandkids|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|wed started a collection of mattels  scale diecasts from the original planes movie for our then  now  year old grandson last year having been so impressed with the qualitydurability of the same scale diecasts of his cars  collection  there were  versions of main character dusty crophopper from that movie racing dusty supercharged dusty jolly wrenches dusty and it looks like theyre doing the same thing with this movie this pontoon dusty as well as a racer dusty and firefighter dusty  this particular one is basically racer dusty with his orangelight bluewhite color scheme minus the jet propellers on his wings but with pontoon floats attached to his wings and wheels attached to the pontoons  grandpas scheduled a day off to go with us including our  year old grandsons first big screen viewing hopefully the action will keep him in his seat and were really looking forward to meeting all of the new characters helping to douse wildfires at piston peak  our understanding is that dusty incurred a racing careerending injury during a training run and is now a trainee working with the piston peak air attack team  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a couple of days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick pontoon dusty up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todaywhen we started the cars  collection we werent sure which would be best mattels smaller models that feel more like super strong plastic rather than metal to us or disney stores larger  scale models with their heavier metal concentration that look so cool in their display cases  we purchased some of each and got our answer quickly we had pieces breaking off of the disney store models like crazy  but both the mattel cars and planes models are holding up really great despite innumerable crashes and nosedives  weve got another grandson coming into this big old world in september and we really think that not only will all of these guysgals survive all three grandkids but hopefully be passed along to our great grandkids someday  hopefully later rather than sooner|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|our  year old grandson fell in love with cars and just as that movies town of radiator springs had its beloved shy fire truck named red the planes movies town of propwash junction has its own fire truck named mayday but hes a lot feistier than red despite the fact that the years have slowed him down a bit his hoses tend to leak and glasses are now a necessity hmm that sounds a lot like grandpa  our grandson and grandpa have so thoroughly enjoyed playing with all of the mattel  scale diecasts weve collected whether it be cars or planes and were all looking forward to our outing on july th to see the planes sequel fire  rescue  well be taking our  year old grandson as well and it should be quite interesting to see if all of the action keeps him in his seat which would be quite a feat  well be adding all of these new characters to the collection come christmas and im sure mayday will end up best buds with red in our home  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a few days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick mayday up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todayif your little person is just getting into planes and youre deciding whether to go with the mattel models or disney stores larger  scale ones we can just tell you that mattels have worked out best for us  disney stores look fantastic and we love that heavy metal feel mattels feel more like very sturdy plastic unfortunately we had pieces all over the place that broke off of the disney store models with only the gentler play of our older grandson let alone the more aggressive play of the younger whos turned out to be hedouble hockey sticks on wheels  the mattel models are holding out very well which is great since we have another grandson making his entrance into the world in september and wed really like to watch our great grandkids running around with them someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|grandpa never had kids of his own so sharing the excitement our  year old grandson has over the new planes sequel fire  rescue by planning a day off on july th to see it with us is possibly just as much fun for him as it is for our grandson  the two of them both had such a great time playing with a construction group called the pack during our grandsons major thomas the train  phase and i know without a doubt that these smokejumpers will get quite a workout in our home  we understand that drip with his skidsteer claw is an outgoing fellow who earned his name due to the fact that hes always leaking oil  he  along with leader dynamite pinecone avalanche and blackout  is part of a ground crew thats transported via an exmilitary plane called cabbie and parachutes down to clear debris caused by wildfires  well be adding all of the new mattel  scale diecasts to his planes collection that already numbers about  dozen characters at christmas but im not sure whos going to have more difficulty waiting our grandson or grandpa  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a few days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick drip up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todaywith the addition of another grandson a couple of years ago who i might add hasnt met a  toy he doesnt love throw were so happy we settled on these durable mattel models for our collections whether it was cars or now planes the fact that they feel more like a very strong plastic rather than metal is a plus for us  they withstand so much more aggressive play than the disney store models weve also had experience with  we loved the looks of their larger  scale models with a heavier metal concentration but they just didnt hold their own especially with grandson   we have another grandson arriving around labor day and we truly believe theyll survive him as well since we fully intend for our great grandkids to play with them one day|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|when our  year old grandson was heavy into his thomas the train phase he particularly enjoyed a construction crew called the pack so i knew right away that the smokejumpers from the planes sequel called fire  rescue will become some of his new  favorites  our understanding is that avalanche is a bulldozer who  along with leader dynamite pinecone blackout and drip  is part of a ground crew thats transported via an exmilitary plane called cabbie and parachutes down to clear debris caused by wildfires  he apparently received his name thanks to having allegedly he denies it triggered a huge landslide  the fact that grandpa is taking a day off from work to see the movie with us on july  just adds to the excitement  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a few days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick avalanche up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todayweve just really been pleased with the cars and original planes diecasts by mattel though we think they feel more like very sturdy plastic than metal  weve added a  year old grandson since we started these collections with another grandson due in september and although the larger  scale disney store models have been so nice looking with their heavier metal concentration they havent held up anywhere near as well as the mattel models have  since we hope to one day see our great grandkids enjoying these durability is key for us and the mattel collections fit the bill for us|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|we were happy to hear that good ol leadbottom would be making a return appearance in the planes sequel  hes a biplane who  in the original planes movie  is dustys boss and the proprieter of the vitaminamulch that dusty sprays on the crops  his mentor skipper and best friend chug also return so i was trying to figure out if there were enough differences in the diecasts from the separate movies to justify a purchase of a second version of each  as far as leadbottom goes mattels  scale diecast version from the original planes movie has yellow wings and tail and signs advertising vitaminamulch on the sides of his gray body  the differences i see from the photo of this fire  rescue version are that his wings and tail appear to be a brighter yellow than the goldishyellow of the original his body appears to be shiny silver rather than gray and hes minus the vitaminamulch signing so well have to see what his role in the new movie will be  in the meantime grandpas taking a day off and our  year old grandson is greatly anticipating going to see the sequel with us on april th and meeting all of the new characters who team it up to put out wildfires at piston peak  update  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a couple of days after i wrote this review they had leadbottom for   a much better price than amazons  price as of today but  the photo accompanying this listing is inaccurate  he does have vitaminamulch signing  he looks exactly the same as the diecast from the original planes movieweve been thoroughly pleased with our investments in the mattel diecast collections cars  and the original planes weve accumulated for our older grandson and since we now have a  year old grandson with a third making his debut around labor day were glad weve stayed with the mattel models versus disney stores larger  scale models  wed purchased several of them when we were building his cars  collection and though they looked so super in their handsome display cases the heavier metal concentration made them so brittle that pieces were busting off all over the place  the mattel models have more of a sturdy plastic feel and thats exactly what they are  sturdy  the planes models have had innumerable nosedives in the  months since christmas have been thrown around unmercifully by our younger grandson with all propellers and wheels still going strong  if theyre able to survive all three grandsons grandpa  i will probably have a more difficult time of that than the diecasts wed love to see them in our great grandkids hands some day|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|well we figured chug would have to return in the planes sequel  hes a fuel truck who is dustys good friend and biggest supporter similar to lightning mcqueen and mater in the cars town of radiator springs  his mentor skipper and boss leadbottom also return so i was trying to determine if there were enough differences in the diecasts from the separate movies to warrant a purchase of a second version of each  as far as chug goes the differences i see are he has silver bumpers with rust versus the brown bumpers of the first version the far right  left lights on his cab roof protrude upward versus not protruding on the first version looks like a lot more rust or dirt perhaps on his doors and fenders and it appears his hubcaps are silver versus brown on the first version  hmm decisions decisions  in the meantime our  year old grandson is beside himself with excitement about going to see the sequel with us on april th and meeting all of the new characters who work together putting out wildfires at piston peak  i was at walmart a couple days after writing this review and they were just putting up a fire  rescue display chug just didnt look different enough to justify a second purchase but i was able to pick up  of the figures for just  a piece  a lot better than amazons  price as of today so thats where ill be getting the rest of his collection unless amazon comes down and saves me a tripthe mattel diecast collections cars  and the original planes have just been such a great investment for us with two grandsons already and another due to arrive in september  the feel is more of an extremely sturdy plastic rather than metal but weve found thats exactly what makes them stand up to rougher play than the disney stores larger  scale models  their handsome display cases is probably where they ought to stay the much heavier metal concentration means the small pieces are more brittle and break off so easily  weve really been pleased with the level of durability and the planes models have lived in our home for  months with all propellers and wheels still intact despite more nosedives than we can begin to count  would love to see them end up in the hands of our great grandkids someday|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|mattel had come out with  different  scale versions of main character dusty crophopper from the original planes movie racing dusty supercharged dusty jolly wrenches dusty and it looks like theyre doing the same thing with the sequel this firefighter dusty as well as a racer dusty and pontoon dusty  i already know this one will be our grandsons favorite with his sharp redblackwhite color scheme as compared to the orangelight bluewhite of the other two versions  were all including grandpa  hes taking a day off from work to go with us on july th so excited to meet all of the new characters who team together to put out wildfires at piston peak  we understand that dusty incurred a racing careerending injury during a training run and is now a trainee working with the piston peak air attack team  having been so pleased with the level of quality of the same scale cars  diecasts we collected for our then  now  year old grandson we decided to start another with the characters from the original planes movie last christmas  we were a little worried about whether the propellers and wheels would stay intact especially since wed added a then  now  year old grandson who enjoys seeing how far he can throw his brothers toys  well were  months in and all of the planes are in super shape  they were just putting up the fire  rescue display at walmart a couple of days after i wrote this review and i was able to pick firefighter dusty up for just  a lot better than amazons  price as of todaywhen we started the cars  collection we  purchased both mattels and disney stores larger  scale models trying to decide which models to pursue  received our answer immediately  the disney store models that had looked so cool in their display cases did not hold up to accidental drops off of the coffee table let alone a  year old brother  the heavier metal concentration meant we had  pieces like spoilers etc breaking off constantly  mattels models feel more like super strong plastic rather than metal to us but our experience has shown us that theyre the ones that will have the degree of durability well need to go through three grandsons we have a third due around labor day so they can hopefully make it into our great grandkids hands one day|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|grandpa  i had heard about several planes diecasts in eggshaped packaging that were going to be released in grocery stores with bulldog being one also heard about supercharged dusty ripslinger arturo and judge davis  we already had bulldog but if you dont kind of a neat way to introduce him into a youngsters collection  bulldog  is a proponent of good sportsmanship the oldest and possibly wisest member of the racing circuit and is one of the movies hero dusty crophoppers primary competitors  hes racer  and we love his bright red  blue with gray colors along with the fact that his name is printed on his sides which is very helpful for grandparents like us  our understanding is that hes based on a havilland dh comet  his characters voice is done by john cleese cofounder of monty python  we were happy when we found bulldog included in a neat target  pack called wings around the globe that also had ripslinger el chupacabra and ishani  not only did it mean we wouldnt have to hunt and peck for each of them during the christmas out of stocks but the  price was reasonable as well given mattels  msrp for eachwe felt comfortable that our choice to collect mattels  versions of the planes over disney stores  versions was the best move for us  wed purchased several disney store versions of cars and our experience was that even though they were very cool looking they shouldve included a tube of super glue with them  they kept breaking unlike our mattel versions  admittedly mattels feel more like a very sturdy plastic than diecast metal disney stores are a much heavier metal concentration but we were more concerned about durability since our grandson puts these guys through some pretty aggressive racing  have a definite inkling that these  along with his cars  will be around once his own kids come along|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|we thought it was pretty clever of disney to use a carstoons installment air mater to introduce a place called propwash junction the hometown of main character dusty crophopper in disneys planes movie and also where our grandson first saw judge davis who was the official air judge and main announcer at the air shows in propwash junction  though he has a minor role in planes hes such a cool looking plane based on the north american pc mustangs that were flown during wwii he sports the number  has black and white stripes on his wings and back sign panels stars a bright red tail and other bits of color here and there  judge davis is one of several diecast planes theyve come out with in  that have easter egg packaging the others we heard about were supercharged dusty crophopper ripslinger bulldog and arturo but we were especially excited about judge davis since he hasnt been previously introduced as a diecast  we wanted to make sure to have him in time for our grandsons birthday box of new planes items to add to the collection we started for him last christmas  our time constraints meant we had to swallow hard and pay over double the  msrp for these mattel diecasts free shipping but at least that was a lot better than the  amazon is asking as of today but if you can be patient we heard these guys will be in select grocery stores where youll be able to find them much more reasonably pricedwe knew from experience with mattels versions of the cars compared to disney stores versions that mattels  planes models were the right ones for us  though disney stores cars and planes are very neat looking larger  scale and made with a heavier diecast metal compared to the feel of very sturdy plastic that we think the mattel models have we always had trouble with pieces breaking off which was very frustrating  durability is the name of the game for us since were hoping well be able to box up his collections and save them for sometime in the future when he can reintroduce them to his own kids|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|cant tell you how excited we were to finally find arturo sold as a single in time to include in a birthday box of new planes diecasts to add to the collection we started for our older grandson last christmas  wed heard they were going to be selling several diecasts in easter egg packaging in select grocery stores with arturo being one of them and couldnt wait to get hold of this guy  the others we heard about were supercharged dusty crophopper ripslinger bulldog and judge davis  the only other ways youve been able to purchase arturo were either as part of the pit row gift pack we didnt want the tent and pitty just the plane or as part of the toysrus north atlantic sprint  pack we already had  of the ones included or as part of a target racing  pack we already had the other  included so we were really happy to find this single in time  arturo was the legendary italian racer in the wings around the globe rally in the planes movie and is a handsome plane  dark blue with a white checkered pattern on his right wing and back side panel his racing number  is featured on his tail as well as directly in front of his eyes and with aeuro printed on his left wing turbo printed on his right wing  tried in vain to find him close to his  msrp but we were running out of time before the birthday so we ended up having to cough up  with free shipping at least it was a bit less than amazon which still has him listed for  as of todayour experience with mattels versions of the cars as well as the planes vehicles is that they feel more like a very sturdy plastic than diecast metal however we purchased several disney store cars items that  although a bit larger made with heavier metal and actually probably neater looking  were no where near as durable as the mattel versions considering the competitiveness of our grandsons races with them  we think this planes collection will be another thatll still be around in decent condition for him to be able to share with his own kids one day|spam
A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|oh man is cabbie sharp looking  grandpa will be taking a day off of work on july  so we can bring our  and  year old grandsons to see disneys planes sequel and theyre so excited  we understand cabbie used to be a military transport plane modeled after a fairchild c flying boxcar whos now back in action carrying the smokejumpers dynamite pinecone avalanche blackout and drip to fight fires at piston peak none of the smokejumpers are included with cabbie  you have to purchase those separately  the back hatch of this oversized  scale plane drops down so up to three of the smokejumpers can parachute out and help save the day  we see walmart has him for  which is the best price weve seen so far so unless amazon comes down quickly the lowest price as of today is    shipping and even more    with free shipping on orders over  guess theyre trying to take advantage of the prerelease hype well probably go ahead and pick one up there and hide him away until christmas  the only negative we see about cabbie is that hes got stickers well see how they hold up as compared to the tampograph decals that were etched into the super durable plastic of the rc everett plane transporter and stephenson train transporter we purchased as part of our cars collectionwe started collecting mattel  scale diecasts for our older grandson with cars  and our satisfaction with the quality led us to starting a planes collection for him last christmas  he really enjoys lining up these sturdy little guys for races with grandpa and i in the family room grandstands rooting for our favorites and theyre durable enough that his little brother can occasionally snatch one and hurl it through the air with no damage done  weve got another grandson due to arrive around labor day so all of these diecast collections will do triple duty and we really believe theyre tough enough that well be able to box them up one day to be shared a generation later with our great grandchildren|spam

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W|and we were excited when we heard walmart was coming out with a couple of new multipacks until we saw that they contained all previously released characters that were already part of the collection wed started for our now  year old grandson last christmas and added to for his april birthday  this one contains legendary mexican racer el chupacabra french canadian racer rochelle and very cool looking  ljh special who had competed in the time trials with main character dusty crophopper but didnt make the top  in order to qualify for the wings around the globe rally  there are so many multipacks offered by the big box stores and if your little ones just getting into planes theres a lot to choose fromone thing we can tell you from personal experience having also compiled a collection of cars  diecasts for our grandson is that at least in our opinion the mattel  scale versions have it all over disney stores  models in the durability factor which pretty much is the primary factor for us given that he has a  year old brother who like to throw things and another little brother due to arrive in september  we love the look and the heavier metal concentration of the disney store models mattels feel more like a very sturdy plastic to us but youd better take out stock in super glue if your youngster intends to do any real playing with disney store items  theyre great for displaying not for playing|spam
A3F2VVIQIY6U64|as much as i love kidrobots work especially the dunny figures ive never been able to get into collecting their toys much because well lets face it most of the coolest stuff is sold on the secondary market for big bucks the abe lincoln dunny immediately comes to mind and that was just a  inch figure but i recently discovered the marvel labbits at a comic store and decided to give them a shot i always liked the labbit figures and combining them with marvel characters as wild as it seems makes for some great looking figures even if i dont like some of the characters i like how they look as little bunniesthe figures are blind boxed on this page at least if you dont know what that means it means you dont know who you get until you open the foil package in the box unless youre on a page for a specific character here you will get a random labbit all of the boxes are the same on the outside and once you open it your figure is inside a foil wrapper you have to open this up to know who you have feeling around wont help the packaging itself looks pretty cool showcasing all the different figures and letting you know which ones are common and rare again all of them look really cool though im a sucker for the carnage antivenom hulk cyclops theres a surprise and silver surfer figures when i saw that the silver surfer one has little swim shorts on that sold mei opened the foil and gotcaptain america not exactly a favorite hero of mine by any means but you know what he looks really good colorful great quality control on the paint features the whole costume as far as i can tell and he even comes with a little shield that can be held in his mouth he feels like your typical vinyl figure in this scaleat around ten bucks a box i feel the pricing is fair collectible vinyl figures have risen in price over the last couple of years even for ones that stay the same size and come blind boxed i was big on disneys vinylmation figures until they kept raising the price and just released too many each month to the point where it was hard to keep up i like this marvel labbit series and might just try to collect them all they remind me of the mighty muggs figures only cuter since theyre bunnies|spam
